==> Sticky: 2008 Applicant Profiles and Admission Results

Postby quizivex » Sun Jan 27, 2008 1:08 am
:D :) :( :o :shock: :? 8) :lol: :x :P :oops: :cry: :evil: :twisted: :roll: :wink: :!: :?: :idea: :arrow: :D :) :( :o :shock: :? 8) :lol: :x :P :oops: :cry: :evil: :twisted: :roll: :wink:

OK let's do it once and for all. Please list your complete profile information on this thread, but do not post any other comments.

Feel free to discuss this data/results on the accompanying thread: Discussion of 2008 Profiles/Results:

Please adhere to the template below (just copy-paste-overwrite), including as much information as you're comfortable providing. The headings will automatically carry over the bolding... just type your info after the colons (and delete items in parenthesis of course).

When you hear from a school, you can announce it on the other thread, but also edit your post here to include the result (put "waiting" if you haven't heard) along with the type of notification (e-mail, snail mail letter, website etc...) and the date you received it. Put decisions in red, if possible. Be sure to write the date in this format (1/25 or 2/3 etc...) so people can edit-find all decisions of a particular date).

EVERYBODY SHOULD POST 8) The more people post, the more helpful this will be for everyone. Don't be intimidated by the first few mind-blowing profiles, lol. In previous years, random applicant data was scattered around hundreds of threads, but if this thread takes off it may become the most complete, useful repository of applicant information available online, and will be an excellent resource for us and future physics undergrads for years to come...

Having this info in an organized fashion allows easy searching. Note with edit-find, you can find everyone applying to Maryland, or everyone who got an acceptance in January (search "1/"), everyone who scored in the 700's on the GRE (search "P: 7") etc...

And for dates and information on Fall 2008 Open House see [here].

Undergrad Institution: UC Berkeley
Major(s): Physics
GPA in Major: 3.97
Overall GPA: 3.94
Length of Degree: 4
Type of Student: international male

GRE Scores:
Q: 790
V: 310
W: 3.5
P: 860

Research Experience: Two neutrino experimental research. One (theta13) for half an year and another (solar-nu squared mass difference) longer than 1 year. No publication. 2 presentations in conference talk. No poster. The research was started during I was in undergrad, and then hired as a paid research assistant at a national lab after the graduation. (I graduated summer 2007).

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: some within physics department. I don't think, although many people here mention about them, they matter at all for top schools.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Research assistant at a national lab.

Special Bonus Points: The research group is quite famous and there are many collaborating institutions. I guess collaborators helped me by talking to admission committees at their institutions. Recommenders are all very famous in their fields. Each recommender wrote different topic about me: one for academic achievement, one for a physics reader work on campus, and one for my research work. In a recommener's class who wrote about my academic achievement, I was told the best student in his last 10 years of teaching. I guess an official employment at a national lab is an advantage, too. I also made my job security in my research group at the lab so that I became an important and official collaborator in this group.

GRE Scores:
Q: 800
V: 650
W: 4.5 (I'm really annoyed with this one)
P: 850

Research Experience: Two summer research positions at high-ranking institutions. I got both of them through professor connections, and I got a paper published out of the first one (first author). Also, I wrote a really good senior thesis on LISA and gravity waves, and I'm still trying to get a paper published out of that (my professor's collaborator has been unbearably slow in getting back to us).

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Goldwater scholarship, Phi Beta Kappa, Magna Cum Laude, senior physics prize

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Tutor/lab assistant for sophomore to senior year.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: not really

Special Bonus Points: One of my recommenders is going to be starting a tenure-track position at Harvard next year.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I think I got really awesome letters from all of my recommenders.

Applying to Where:

NYU - Physics - Cosmology
..........Accepted, emailed 02/08/2008
Harvard - Astronomy - Cosmology/Astrophysics
..........Accepted, called 02/12/2008 ($28k stipend for five years)
UCSB - Physics - Cosmology
..........Rejected, online 03/10/2008
U of Chicago - Physics - Cosmology
..........Accepted, postmarked 02/20/2008 ($30k TA/Fellowship/summer RA)
UNC Chapel Hill - Physics - Cosmology
..........Accepted, postmarked 01/31/2008 - offer declined
U of Wisconsin, Madison - Physics - Cosmology

UCSC - Physics - Cosmology
..........Accepted, emailed 02/27/2008

Last year I applied to the physics programs at Berkeley, Brown, Harvard, MIT, and Columbia and got rejected from all of them. Given that I've now got some good choices, I'm convinced that the whole process is a crap chute.

Undergrad Institution: State school, listed top 10/20 (depends on list) - UCLA! Go BRUINS!
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): Math (did not appear on transcripts at time of application)
GPA in Major: ~3.988 (depends how you calculate, between 3.98 and 3.99)
Overall GPA: 3.939
Length of Degree: 5 years
Position in Class: Probably near top?
Type of Student: Domestic male minority

GRE Scores:
Q: 780/90%
V: 640/91%
W: 5.0/I forget
P: 760/69% (Sucky! But this makes me a proud member of the 700 club that's getting in places! :D)

Research Experience: Lots! But only some of it is high-quality.
1. Medical Physics Internship at a teaching university's hospital, one summer. Really just programming a color-coding scheme for brain scans. No physics actually involved whatsoever.
2. One quarter solo chemical research. I was given NOTHING and told run with it. By the time I figured out that they left me high and dry, the quarter was over.
3. 2.5 years, beam simulations, one publication at a conference, first author out of like 5, no peer review.
4. One summer, materials science research, LBNL.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Two scholarships, participation in a program designed to get minority students into a PhD program continuing on to a completely academic career.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: 1 quarter tutor, and physics and math clubs.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: A decent sprinkling of A+'s for grades. They look pretty but don't show up in the GPA.

Special Bonus Points: Minority status? I don't believe this means anything. You have the scores and you're good, or you don't and you aren't. If anything, it can only hurt you.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: ...not really...?

Applying to Where (listed in rough order of preference when applying):
..... Didn't apply to too many east-coast schools because I wouldn't want to go there. I'm a California guy. I don't want to go to Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Cornell, etc. over something like UCSD or UCLA. It would be hard for me to deal with the weather, I wouldn't be happy, my research would suffer. Those things can torpedo your PhD! I'd rather complete somewhere not so "good" than quit at some place that's first-tier!

Caltech - Physics - Rejected, 3/21, e-mail
..... This is almost literally in my back yard. I'm SO sad I didn't get in, but it's probably because I didn't tailor my personal statement to them. I knew I should have, it's my own fault.
Stanford - Physics - ACCEPTED!!! 2/29, e-mail - Matriculated!
..... This was one of those ones that I was like, "Okay, Stanford is like top 3, it's in CA, I have to apply." I didn't know much about it, other than it was pretty good. But after visiting, I love it there! The people are friendly - even the PROFS! The atmosphere is great, the weather is cool but not freezing like the east is. The grad students retain at least some level of normalcy. It's in California, and they have amazing labs that have been painted in the last couple years (lol - just visit Berkeley, you'll know what I mean...). They have great funding and, lol, I could just go on, but I won't!
MIT - Physics - Rejected. 3/2/2008, snail mail dated 2/26
..... I actually visited MIT last fall under a special program. I had to apply because, again, top 3. But I wasn't thrilled with the extreme nerdiness (blasphemy!) or the way they bragged that you never have to go outside because all the buildings are connected. So I wasn't broken up about not getting in.
U Chicago - Physics - Rejected. 3/2/2008, snail mail dated 2/27
..... One place an adviser recommended. I still don't know too much about it, and I'm not too broken up about this one either. They were condescending in their rejection letter. It's cold there too.
Berkeley - Physics - Accepted! 3/4, e-mail - Declined.
..... Berkeley is great for some people, but I don't like the people. (Once again, I know, blasphemy! Lol!) They're a little out there for my tastes. The professors seemed withdrawn. The grad students seemed cautious, and it seemed like a politically-charged environment. Housing is horrible in the area too. But other people LOVED it, over Stanford even, so I think this may just be a personal thing.
UCSB - Physics - Rejected
..... Their online application looked complete. Then I realized there was a SECOND link to check my status, of course underneath all the green check-marks, and I had a transcript and a letter of rec missing. By this time I was accepted to Stanford, and I really didn't have the energy or time to check it out. I got my rejection a few days later. I am annoyed that they didn't TELL me I had materials missing. Caltech, UCSD, UCLA, and Chicago all called/e-mailed when I was missing part of my app!
UCLA - Physics - Accepted! 2/28, e-mail - Declined.
..... So hard to say no! It's also close to home. But in the end it was important to go somewhere new, and Stanford was offering me better funding, and it really is the natural next step, especially if I stay in my current area of research.
UCSD - Physics - Accepted. 2/20, e-mail - Declined.
..... Declined on the advice of almost everybody I talked to. Stanford is definitely a better place to go for me.
U of Florida - Physics - Accepted. 2/25, snail mail - Declined.
..... This was my backup school. I was pretty sure I didn't want to go there.

Hi everyone... Long time lurker, first time poster....

Undergrad Institution: Big School in Canada, in top 10. Has reputable Physics program
Major(s): Double major in Physics and Mathematics
Minor(s): None
GPA in Major: 3.98
Overall GPA: top 5 in my school
Length of Degree: 5 years
Position in Class: pretty high, see overall GPA
Type of Student: Domestic Canadian... Mixed Asian background

GRE Scores:
Q: 800
V: 480 (opps!!)
W: 5.5
P: 870(2007) 490(2006) :?

Research Experience: Several University Labs, 3 research internships for a large oil company, and 2 summer research internships at Fermilab. I am also working fulltime as a scientist for a large oil company

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: award for high grades, award from work, award from the Canadian association of physicists

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Full time job, mentor high school students, and judged and organize science fairs

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Nothing really... I do martial arts and I swim...but that doesn't really help

Special Bonus Points: I scored a perfect 100 percent(didn't make any mistakes all semester) in courses on tensor analysis, and elementary particle physics. Reference letters from a 'known' prof. and from a "high up" in the company I work for.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Only negative stuff.... but makes my admission results make some more sense. I started off at one school but transfered after 2 years. My GPA kind of sucked but there was some 'personal' reasons that made my time there sucky. Having my GPA increase significantly from school to school can/has been interpreted as meaning I transfered to an inferior program. Also note that the first time I wrote the GRE physics I did pretty bad. That didn't help me with the schools that averaged scores.

Applying to Where:

Princeton
------Accepted - Email, with stipend(early March)
Yale
------Accepted - Email, with stipend (end of February) - Offer Accepted
Cornell
------Rejected (mid March)
UCLA
------Rejected (late January)
UCSD
------Rejected(early April)
University of British Columbia
------Accepted - With stipend (mid January)
University of Western Ontario
------Accepted - With stipend (late March)
McGill
------Wait listed then Accepted (early April)

There you have it. It is now said and done. *note* I have edited this entry one final time to make it more accurate and less ambiguous, for the benefit of future students. Looking at test scores and marks doesn't tell the whole story and I think my application was certainly one of those cases.

Re: 2008 Physics Applicant Profiles & Admission Results

I hope this info helps international students weight their chances when applying for Ph.D. programs in the US and Canada.

Undergrad Institution: Private university in Peru
Graduate Institution: Big public university in The Netherlands (all the info below corresponds to this program, since I believe it is what was taken into account by admission committees when reviewing my file).
Major(s): M.Sc. in Theoretical Physics
Minor(s):
GPA in Major: 84%
Overall GPA: 84%
Length of Degree: 2 years
Position in Class: Near the top
Type of Student: International

GRE Scores:
Q: 790
V: 470
W: 4.5
P: 760 (69%) Yeah, yeah, I know, too low for having a masters degree, but, hey, I didn't have much time to study and I am just plain bad at written tests.

TOEFL Total: 114/120

Research Experience: Thesis written under the supervision of one of the professors of the string theory group at my university. No publications.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Big scholarship from the Dutch government, one scholarship from the university and one from the Institute for Theoretical Physics.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: TA for undergraduate courses such as Electromagnetism, Physics 1 and 3.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: None that I can think of.

Special Bonus Points: Well-known recommenders within the string theory community. As part of my graduate program, I have already taken advanced courses.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Maybe the fact that I was invited with scholarships to attend two summer schools abroad when I was still an undergraduate in Peru? Although, I don't think it matters.

Applying to Where:

Stanford - Physics - String theory - Rejected
Caltech - Physics - String theory - Rejected
UCSB - Physics - String theory - Rejected (was really hoping for this one)
UCLA - Physics - String theory - Rejected
UPenn - Physics - String theory - Rejected
Columbia - Physics - String theory - Rejected
Austin - Physics - String theory - Haven't heard back from them and I really don't care anymore.
Brown - Physics - String theory - Accepted with usual TA position
Stony Brook - Physics - String theory - Accepted with usual TA position
Toronto - Physics - String theory - Accepted with usual TA position
McGill - Physics - String theory - Rejected
Perimeter Institute - Physics - String theory - Accepted (financial package to come)

Now that the whole process is over for me, I regret applying to some of the schools above, namely Caltech, Columbia and Austin. I think I just applied to them because of their overall reputation, rather than focusing on their string theory research, which is actually not close to my own interests.

Update: I decided to go to Perimeter.
