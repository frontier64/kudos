GRE Scores :
Q: 170 (98%)
V: 161 (87%)
W: 5.0 (93%)
P: 750 (61%) (I know some of you would cry at this, but I was thrilled :roll: )

I hope that my profile inspires people with "meh" pGRE scores from "meh" universities. Just do research out the wazoo, and you'll be okay. Looking back, I wish I would've applied to better schools (or saved my money, and applied to fewer) but I really had no data to determine what my chances were. Nonetheless, I am so excited to go to Cornell!!

Applied everywhere by 13 December.

Final Thoughts:
Whew, finally! This has been an extremely stressful time! Here are some thoughts throughout my experience:
[list][*]In the end I was accepted at the places most relevant to my interests (even though all of them were still very relevant)[*]As an international applicant, I ignored everyone who said getting into a public university is extremely hard, but I can confirm and stress that it is.[*]I got rejected in universities much lower ranked than the ones that I got accepted at. Whatever your scores and whatnot are, do apply to universities in every ranking bands (as long as they are very relevant to your interests), don't focus on one single range of rankings.[*]Remember, your PhD is as good as you make of it.
Anyways, good luck everyone! and goodbye Physicsgre. You've been a helpful stress reliever at times and a massive stress inducer at others.

Well, since I've benefited from this forum so much, I figure I will post.

Undergrad Institution: Very small school with no reputation in Physics.
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): Mathematics
GPA in Major: 3.0?
Overall GPA: 3.34
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: 1 of 1, small school
Type of Student: Domestic white male

GRE Scores :
Q: 166 (92%)
V: 155 (67%)
W: 4.5 (80%)
P: 750 (61%)


Research Experience: Two summers of research at Penn, one in chemical engineering and the other in Physics.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Sigma Pi Sigma in undergrad. As a teacher I won an engineering award.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Worked for 3 years as a high school Physics teacher. Taught APs.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Masters in education from Penn.

Special Bonus Points: One summer I worked for a very well known professor of Physics at Penn, and he is writing one of my letters.


Applying to Where:

UPenn - Physics - Biophysics Rejected- 4/7
U Maryland - Physics - Biophysics Rejected- 2/22
Duke - Physics - Biophysics Waitlisted- 3/23 Rejected- 4/14
U Minnesota - Physics - Biophysics Waitlisted- 3/17 Rejected- 4/14
Brown - Physics - Biophysics Rejected- 3/18 Sent an email about an unpaid Masters program.
Yale - Physics - Biophysics Rejected- 2/26
Lehigh - Physics - Biophysics Accepted! - 3/1 28K TA, guaranteed 5 years
Bryn Mawr - Physics - Biophysics Waitlisted- 3/30 Rejected- ???
Georgetown - Physics - Biophysics (Industrial Leadership in Physics program) Waitlisted- 4/9 Rejected- 4/13

Wow. I really didn't expect to do this poorly. I thought with 9 schools, I would have my pick from 3 or 4 schools. Maybe it was a competitive year, but I'm kind of discouraged. If I could go back and do this again, I would have applied to different schools. I probably would have scratched Yale, Maryland and Brown from the list. I've spent a good amount of time with some people from Penn, so I thought my chances were higher than they actually were. Either way, this was a humbling experience.

I did go on a visit at Lehigh. From what I could tell, they have a good program and it will get strong in the next few years. They guarantee you funding for the five years and make every attempt to make it only a five year degree, unlike other schools who sometimes have students for 7 or 8 years. It 's a good fit for me, since they are getting more professors in Biophysics. If anyone has a question on Lehigh, feel free to email me.

Slightly terrified that I'm doing this.

Undergrad Institution: State university, not bad in physics
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): Mathematics
GPA in Major: 3.5-ish
Overall GPA: 3.3 (>3.8 Jr/Sr)
Length of Degree: Oh god too long
Position in Class: Above average, could be worse.
Type of Student: Domestic white male

GRE Scores : (revised or old version?)
Q: 163 (86%)
V: 164 (94%)
W: 3.5 (38%, ouch. Hopefully they don't check this)
P: 740 (59%) EDIT: Got 830 (76%) on the October PGRE. And I'd thought I had bombed it.


Research Experience: One summer doing mathematics work on differentiable manifolds. 2 years working on photometry of distant lensing galaxies with frustratingly little progress.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Dean's list a few times, but that's not worth much I'd assume.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Tutoring both as part of physics club and as a job, physics outreach. Assisting professor in writing a wiki for class.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Eagle scout, but that's from a while ago.

Special Bonus Points: Nothin'.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Halfway through my college career my GPA was below a 3, so bringing it up this far shows improvement (I hope).

Applying to Where:

UCSC - Astronomy & Astrophysics -- Rejected 2/16. They were one of the schools I was really gunning for, too...
UCR - Physics -- Accepted 1/28!!! First acceptance! 27k stipend and other stuff.
UC Davis - Physics
UCLA - Astronomy -- Rejected 3/5
CU Boulder - Astrophysical & Planetary Science -- Rejected 2/09. Not a big surprise, but still a bit of a bummer.
UH Manoa - A&A -- Rejected 2/19. I thought I had a pretty good chance of getting in here, but I guess not.
Columbia - Astronomy -- Rejected 2/29. Leap day is not my day. I kind of had a feeling this was coming, since I really screwed up the personal statement and POI bit, but I didn't notice until way too late.
UMD - Astronomy -- Rejected 2/12
UWashington - Astronomy -- Rejected 3/17
UW Madison - Astronomy -- Rejected 3/15
Cornell - Astronomy -- Rejected 3/10
PennState - A&A -- Rejected 1/27 :(

Edit 2/27: I don't want to say I'm losing hope, but I'm trying to let myself down gently for the next rejections that will be coming my way. UCR has great faculty and I'm thrilled I got into the physics program, but there's something that tears away a little bit of your soul when you get rejection letters, like you're just not good enough. Still hoping for some good news.

2/29: Rejected from half. At least I got in somewhere. Emailed Cornell, the UWs, then gonna email the UCs. Heard nothing from them.

3/17: I'm not gonna lie, getting rejected from every single astronomy program isn't very fun.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

Special Bonus Points:
-1 of my recommenders probably mentioned my pending publication
-1 of my recommenders is pretty big in spintronics

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:

Applying to Where: All PhD

Cornell (Applied) - CME/AMO -Accepted 2/11! $25k TA for 9 months Will Attend
UIUC - CME/AMO - Accepted 2/12! 9 month TA + TA/RA summer = $22k Declined
Michigan - CME/AMO - Unofficial acceptance 3/04 Accepted 3/08! $2.42k/month TA/fellowship including summer Declined
Colorado Boulder - CME/AMO - Rejected 3/01
Penn State - CME/AMO - Accepted 2/09! $20k TA + $4k fellowship + $4k summer = $28k Declined
Minnesota - CME - Accepted 2/03! $18k TA + summer = $25k Declined
Rutgers - CME - Accepted 2/10! $26k TA + $1700-$4000 summer Declined
Texas A&M - CME/AMO - Accepted 2/12! $1.85k/month TA + RA/TA summer + $2k fellowship Declined
UPitt - CME - Unofficial acceptance/interview request 1/28 Accepted 2/19! 2-term TA guaranteed + summer possible = 26k Declined

Reflections: With 8/9 acceptances, I really have nothing to complain about and am extremely excited about my options. Though I applied to most schools as CME/AMO, I believe my application was much stronger in CME than in AMO (I also preferred CME over AMO). I attribute part of this to one of my recommenders, who is pretty big in spintronics, seeing that many of my faculty of interest mentioned that they knew him. I also emailed faculty, many who happened to be part of the admissions committee, at my top schools early in February to show my interest (NOT inquiring about my application status), and most replied positively (although many did not reply until after I was accepted). The last schools I heard from were Michigan and Boulder, which also happened to be the highest ranked in AMO of the schools on my list. I was very surprised to have been rejected from Boulder but accepted to Michigan since Boulder accepts the highest number of grad students according to gradschoolershopper, while Michigan was planning to have an incoming class of about 25 students. However, upon revisiting the faculty research, I realized Michigan was a much better fit with my research interests than Boulder.

Possibly Very Important Note: I contacted faculty in all of the top 25 schools I applied to EXCEPT for CU Boulder, and they were the only one to reject me.

Undergrad Institution: An Israeli university well renowned for Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, less for Physics
Major(s): Physics and Electrical Engineering, going to be an engineer as well as B.Sc in Physics
GPA in Major: 90/100
Overall GPA: 90/100
Length of Degree: 4.5 years
Position in Class: Top 10 or 15%

W: 4.0 (56%)
P: 920(87%) Can only thank Conquering the Physics GRE book for this. Get it.


TOEFL Total: 116

Research Experience: Research project in non-equilibrium stat-mech for a couple of months, ongoing. Research project in nano antennas and plasmonics for 3 months, ongoing and getting nice results. 6 months project in image processing and computer vision, done and gathered nice attention from both faculty and the industry but sadly no publication yet (beaurocracy! :( )

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: A couple of times on the dean's list. Would have been there more often but I rarely took enough credits to be there due to work. Still finishing my degree on time though. Won second place in an excellent project award competition in the EE faculty. The pool for the competition is about 200 projects from the EE department undergraduate students.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Served for 3 years in the military doing operations research with Matlab, SQL etc. Been working for over 2 years during my undergrad in the field of communication algorithm engineering which mainly involves designing communication systems, writing simulations in Matlab, understanding and implementing IEEE papers in practical functioning systems, digital signal processing and more.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

Special Bonus Points: Famous recommenders from the EE faculty. Recommenders from physics are less known. Two advanced courses in stochastic processes which fit one of my research interests. Great grades in the more important and advanced Physics courses. A specialization in electro-optics (Optics, Electro-Optics, Electro-Optical systems, Distributed Systems courses) which may also fit a research interest.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I have relatively a lot of experience in the EE fields of communications and DSP and less in physics, even though physics interests me much more. This is due to both financial considerations (work to fund my studies) and the fact that I was required to do two projects in EE and none in physics during my degree. As a result I have great recommendations from EE/work and not as many or from people as famous as in EE from the Physics faculty. This may be a weak point in the application. I am 27 years old which I guess is not the norm in the US but that is due to mandatory military service for 3 years.

Applying to Where: My safeties are at home, so not applying to less known schools

MIT - Physics- CMT/AMO - Rejected 2/12 by website
Harvard - Physics- AMO - Rejected 2/24 by email.
Columbia - Physics- CMT - Rejected 2/27 by email
Cornell - Applied Physics- CM/AMO - Admitted 2/11 by email, 25k TA for 9 months :D
Princeton - Physics- CMT/AMO - Rejected 2/22 by email. What a nice rejection letter though
Stanford - Physics- CMT/AMO - Rejected 2/22 by email
Berkeley - Physics- CMT/AMO - Rejected 3/6 by email
UCSB - Physics- CMT/AMO - Rejected 3/1 by email
Caltech - Physics- CMT/AMO - Rejected 2/12 by email

This has been (and will continue to be) one heck of a step out of the comfort zone. In physics, Israelis almost never go abroad before their postdoc. Our academic culture does not encourage publication and research during undergrad. Since Israeli universities rarely get grad students from abroad, having a promising future grad student seeking to leave the country is a blow to the local academia, and as such, it is not encouraged by the system, whether intentionally or not. Future students with similar background should seek research experience as early as possible, which means actively hunting for projects, going to talk with professors and so on from about second year onwards. I now have 3 publications in review, 2 for conferences and 1 for a journal, but they arrived about 2-3 months too late for the applications. If I had started research earlier it would have been different I guess.
I got accepted to just one program, but it looks like a great program and I have no doubt I'll have great opportunities there :D

The College of William & Mary - Applied Science Withdrew application after receiving other offers
University of Cincinnati - Physics Withdrew application after receiving other offers

My final 4 were Georgia Tech, W&M, UF, and IU. I declined GA Tech after deciding I didn't want to join a program (even if I had been accepted) that encouraged people on the wait list to accept a pre-april 15 offer and then switch if they were accepted after the 15th to Tech's program if admitted, as well as not even attempting to help me arrange a visit to their dept. I declined W&M because their program size was too small for me, although it was an excellent program that I would suggest anyone look into. In the end, I accepted IU over UF due to the wider match in my research interests at IU, although UF had a FANTASTIC program. Thanks for being there Physicsgre; it's been real.

... and few others (will update later, probably by end of March)

Reflection:
First of all don't get discouraged, there was a story behind almost every rejection of mine. I'll try to elaborate below.

My profile was "stellar" according to some fellows here. And I felt that too. I was pretty confident at the start of the application period, which turned out to be not quite successful. I thought that the low Verbal would not hurt, and I still think it did not. I have seen quite a number of people got into top schools with that Verbal. Anyways for some schools I don't know what happened, but here are few details that might help future applicants:

1. MIT: I got interviewed by POI. It was pretty obvious after the interview that we did not match, both research interest (some overlaps though) and personality. I could have pretended to be someone else to get in, but my ego didn't allow me to.

2. Yale + Harvard: I got waived from application fee so I applied to these two despite having no interest. Just playing the odd here.

3. Glasgow: interviewed with POI, did not find common interest afterwards. I would have withdrawn anyways.

4. Caltech + Stanford: My top two. I feel that I have done what I could so no regret here. Just a little sad that I didn't get in. Basically I have done researched into POI's profile, read their papers and tailored my SOP accordingly. I also emailed them well in advance asking about their research and available positions. Not even a reply though, not nice at all! I know they are probably too busy but a simple acknowledgement would be fine (Not all POIs were like this though, I will share my stories with nicer POIs from other schools once everything is over).

5. UMD: Research interest matches mine. Got JQI and QUICS over there. Probably go UMD if nothing changes.

Undergrad Institution: Tufts University (School of Arts and Sciences, not very good reputation in physics)
Major(s): Math & Physics
Minor(s): N/A
GPA in Major: 4.00 (8 A+s and 10 As, but A+s aren't counted higher)
Overall GPA: 3.89
Length of Degree: 4
Position in Class: No idea. Probably very high up for my major. Not top throughout majors though.
Type of Student: International male from Nepal

GRE Scores : revised
Q: 170 (98%)
V: 166 (96%)
W: 6.0 (99%)
P: 950 (91%)


Research Experience:

Independent research advised by a professor over the summer of 2015. Tested the effectiveness of two data classifiers (SVMs and BDTs) in classifying data of different numbers of features and different types of spreads. Also tested on Higgs data. Will be published as an ATLAS note, but not before applications are due.

Working on a thesis that studies the quantization of interaction fields in the formalism of principle fibre bundles. Involves differential geometry and gauge theory. This is what I really want to do in grad school, and it will span throughout this year. My thesis will be put in Tufts archives and might be published if we can find anything significant. Advised by one physics professor and two mathematics professors.

Working with a professor to look for experimental methods that will allow us to make data analysis as sensitive to new physics data as possible. Involves simulating data for new physics and finding ways to make cuts and take ratios in a way that new physics is significantly distinguishable from standard model results.


Awards/Honors/Recognitions:

Howard Sample Prize Scholarship for performing well in intro level physics courses.

Summer Scholars Grant for conducting the aforementioned project that compared two different event classifiers.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs:

Have been a RA for three years, which hopefully shows some good traits. I will definitely but it in my resume. Also got an "academic role model"
award from my employer, so that was nice.

Special Bonus Points:

Have taken one grad level course, taking one right now, and will have taken two before graduating. Also minority status?

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I have a high GPA, but have a couple of anomalously bad grades (C and D) in relevant courses that may hold me back.

Applying to Where:

(Mostly tentative list for my own records atm)

United States
UIUC - Astrophysics - applied 28/11Accepted! $22,000/yr TA stipend 02/02 Will attend!
UW-Madison - HEP/cosmology - applied 28/11 Accepted! $22,000/yr TA stipend 26/01

UChicago - Astrophysics - applied 14/12 Rejected via website 10/02 :(
Northwestern - Astrophysics - applied 07/12/15 Rejected, I presume

I suffered a family bereavement during my exams last year which affected my performance. I read a load of conflicting advice over whether to include this factor in my statement of interest. Ultimately I decided against it in all but two applications - incidentally these were the only two schools that accepted me. Obviously there were probably many other factors that influenced the decisions, but do what you will with the information.

Also, for what it's worth, I got rejections from top schools quite a bit later than I expected from an international with my PGRE and grades. Obviously I didn't make it through to most of them in the end, but I got the impression I was pretty close to a few. My advice would be to be ambitious and don't pigeonhole yourself into one tier based just on your scores. I firmly believe enthusiastic Letters of Recommendation and a focused, directed Statement of Interest can make a real difference to an overwise average application.

Parting thoughts: I think I was unusually lucky because a) I had three strong letters from three well-known faculty at three different institutions, and b) I wrote a reasonably technical research statement which showed I know how to write about astronomy. For what it's worth, I didn't contact any professors at places I was applying during the application process, so I surmise this is not critical.

Q: 162 (83%)
V: 153 (59%)
W: 4.0 (56%)
P: 930 (91%) *thanks Conquering the PGRE, you guys rock !!!*

Research Experience:
0.5 years Senior year Thesis on developing a unique biometric system (hardware and software)- published paper (1st author) and won accolades for the same
Almost 1 year at astronomy research institution in India, two projects- one with a sr. professor from John Hopkins on spectroscopy, other with a Russian ISRO scientist on comet morphology (in collaboration with PSI, Arizona). Both successful, received LOR from the russian one (win !)- abstract accepted for comet project, paper on way
Another 6 month internship at research institute starting in Jan 2016

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: (not sure to what extent they individually matter though)
TEDx talk- Head of event management.
Model United Nations (MUN)- moderator

Special Bonus Points:
College did not offer many physics courses apart from the basic ones, so took one special project on Quantum entanglement and did well on that.
Learnt programming on IDL, Python, IRAF, MATLAB. any observation astronomy work pretty much requires these, so....

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:
Great letters from all 3 recommenders, the college profs don't have particularly impressive titles, but got to know them personally
Spent like 4 months on the freakin' SOP. You tell me it doesn't matter and I'll punch you. In your face.

*** This is something that I should mention- I suffered from a spinal injury and sudden osteoprosis in my 4th semester which got me bed ridden for 6 months. That coupled with medications and the psychological pain damn near ruined everything. BUT I had my friends and family. Got it up (no pun intended). Became healthy. This did affect my grades so I mentioned it in the SOP (just a line or two), but doubtful about the importance. Nevertheless, it was a crucial part of my life and needed to be said ***

Applying to Where: All for observational astronomy (interests in extragalactic,protostars and image processing), all PhD (Physics with astro), bar one. Looked into speciality of each university and resp profs, then decided which profile suited me best

Closed my eyes. Pressed the apply button - PhD astronomy
Caltech

I am applying to normal jobs at the same time as grad school. Low GPA and extremely low test scores will be my downfall. But since this GPA is average, the GRE revised is average, and the PGRE is around 50%... I figured I'd post and update when acceptances or rejections come so people in the future can glean whether it's a crapshoot or fools errand with stats like this.

Undergrad Institution: A Top 5 USNWR school for undergrads. Good grad reputation in physics but I don't know about undergrad.
Major(s): Physics
GPA in Major: 3.13 lol
Overall GPA: 3.15 lol
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: No idea, but probably above average considering a 3.0 is honors in the major... that grade deflation...
Type of Student: Domestic male, technically a minority even though I look white. The US Census has some pretty bad definitions.

GRE Scores : Revised
Q: 159
V: 160
W: 4.5
P: 660 lol

Research Experience: I have been doing research all four years. 3 years of observational astronomy. 1 year of dark matter experimental astrophysics. 1.5 years of AMO but it will be 2 years by the time I graduate since I currently work in this lab. I am not an author on any papers. However, I am writing a senior thesis on my AMO research.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Deans list during my junior year. My GPA is high enough for honors, all I need to do is finish the thesis. I also received a summer research fellowship from my school.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: I was an SPS officer and an officer in another physics based club at my school.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: No, just an average student to be honest.

Special Bonus Points: The professor I work for now seems to personally know at least one AMO professor at every school I am applying to. Not sure how much of a boost that is though. I expect to have good rec letters as well, one from each of the three professors I have worked for in my time during undergrad.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I went from having a 2.4 GPA at one point to where I am now. Worst grades were during my freshman year. Then I brought them up to B/B+/A- range after I finally got into the swing of college. My high school definitely did not prepare me.

Applying to Where: All are AMO/Quantum Information and physics departments except for Arizona which is the optical sciences department.

UC Santa Barbara - REJECTED 3/1
UC Los Angeles - REJECTED 3/9
University of Washington - REJECTED 3/1
University of Arizona - REJECTED 3/4 by admission to M.Sc
University of Wisconsin - REJECTED 2/5
University of Michigan
Northwestern University - Application feedback 1/20, Interview 1/21
Rice University - Application feedback 1/4
University of Toronto - ACCEPTED 2/29 - $15,000
University of Illinois - Urbana Champaign - REJECTED 3/6
Duke University - ACCEPTED 1/27 - $29,960
Pennsylvania State University
Stony Brook University - ACCEPTED 1/22 - $26,500 - Declined
University of Texas - Austin - ACCEPTED 3/14 - $18,000

My academics are low, but I don't really care. I've worked really hard for it, and I'm proud of what I have done, including getting to be a part of awesome research projects.

Undergrad Institution: Top school in physics
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s):
GPA in Major: 4.0/5.0
Overall GPA: 4.1/5.0
Length of Degree: 4
Position in Class: Probably average to below average
Type of Student: Domestic, minority, male

GRE Scores :
Q:156
V:157
W: 4.0
P: 700 (51%) I've never been any good at tests, but hey it's technically average.


Research Experience: 2.5 years at home institution working in nonlinear dynamics and a little bit of plasma physics. I have been with the project from the start and have had a say on the direction that it is going. I presented at APS Division of Plasma Physics meeting in Nov. 2015. This will be my thesis, and will most likely result in a first author publication.
One REU working in numerical relativity, it's where I learned about high performance computing. Made a poster and presented at their summer event.
One REU working in cosmological simulations. Will present poster at the AAS meeting in January 2016.

(At your school or elsewhere? What field? How much time? Any publications (Mth author out of N?) or conference talks etc...)

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: None

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: 5 semesters as a TA for introductory mechanics and E&M.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: All my research experiences, while in different fields, have very common skill sets, and have built off each other quite nicely.

Special Bonus Points: The extended group I was a part of for my research in cosmological simulations includes the professors I want to work with at Harvard and Caltech.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I've designed and launched a high powered rocket.

Applying to Where: All of them (PhD programs) are for astrophysics

Harvard - Astronomy-Rejected 2/11/16
MIT - Physics-Rejected 2/12/16
Stanford - Physics-Rejected 2/22/16
UC Santa Barbara - Physics-Rejected 3/1/16
Caltech - Astronomy-Rejected 2/24/16
Cornell - Astronomy-Rejected 3/10/16
CU-Boulder - Astrophysical and Planetary Sciences-Rejected 2/9/16
Ohio State - Astronomy-Accepted 1/6/16-Declined This was a tough choice. The dynamic of the department was great!
U Washington - Astronomy-Interview 2/16/16-Rejected 3/17/16
UT Austin - Astronomy-Rejected 2/5/16
Michigan State - Astronomy-Accepted 1/19/16-DeclinedAlso a tough choice. They have some really cool research there.
U Michigan-Ann Arbor - Astronomy- Interview 1/29/16-Accepted 1/30/15-Will attend!
Perimeter Scholars (Waterloo)-Masters-Rejected 4/13/16

My advice would be to reach as high as you want, regardless of PGRE or other circumstances. Of course, get a good range of selectivity. While I had a tough choice to make, I appreciate having the opportunity to have three awesome choices.

Undergrad Institution: state school (2nd biggest campus in my state university system)
Major(s): physics
Minor(s): you could say mathematics
GPA in Major: 2.3/4
Overall GPA: 2.4/4
Length of Degree: 9 years (2007-2011, then 2014-2016)
Position in Class: struggling for a big part of it
Type of Student: male, minority

GRE Scores : I have decided to take it but for future applications not this round.

Research Experience:
1 summer internship in nuclear engineering at a cyclotron facility of my school.
1 summer internship working in the physics department of my school in medical physics.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Does Deans list count? if so: Deans list fall 2014, spring 2015, fall 2015.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: none

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: surviving the struggle? lol

Special Bonus Points:
male minority: but I don't think it matters for schools outside the US so...
graduates courses: Nonlinear dynamics differential equations (birfurcation etc...); boundary value problem in differential equations; Numerical Analysis for ODE/PDE; Vector Calculus ; Microeconomics Theory I; Macroeconomics Theory I; Statistical Mechanics

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: my gpa is subpar and this will probably earn me rejections I think. I tried to select a good mix of highly selective schools (because why not) and schools I think I can get in. I had a rough patch a couple of years ago which lasted for 2-3 years, partly due to some illness and me being immature post illness (bad study habits, and I dropped out). I tried explaining that inside my personal statement, not sure it's going to cut it but it's still worth a try. I came back to school after a 3 years break during which I worked for a while. my gpa since coming back have been 3.5 (3 semester + 1 summer) which I think is very different from my cgpa which is only 2.4.

Applying to Where:

All my stuff is theoretical physics or applied mathematics.

University of Montreal - math - Computational Finance msc Admitted
University of Montreal - economics - economics Msc Admitted
City University London - economics - Financial Economics msc Admitted
Kingston University - economics - Financial Economics msc Admitted
University of Queen Mary London - Mathematics - Network Science Msc Admitted

McGill - math - applied math msc
McMaster - math - math msc
University of Strathclyde - Finance - Mres mathematical Sciences withdrawn was probably going to get a rejection.
Manchester - physics - theoretical physics mres (statistical mechanics, econophysics)
University of Sydney - IT & Engineering - Engineering mphil (statistical mechanics, econophysics)
University of Technology Sydney - Business - Economics PhD (Complexity economics, econophysics) - rejected
University of Paris-Saclay - Physics - M2 Physics of Complex Systems
University of Paris 1 - University of Sorbonne - Economics - Dual Msc quantitative economics Most Likely Rejected

Edinburgh - physics - mathematical physics msc (statistical mechanics, econophysics) rejected
King College London - math - complex systems msc (statistical mechanics, econophysics) - rejected
Imperial College London - math - stochastic analysis mres (financial mathematics) rejected
London School of Economics - math - applicable math msc (lse is well known for finance and economics) rejected
University of Adelaide - physics - (statistical mechanics, econophysics) - withdrawn (asked for final transcript, it's stupid who does that?)
University of Essex - Economics - Computational Economics Msc (Complexity economics) rejected
University of York - Statistics - Computational Finance Msc rejected
University of York - Economics - Financial Economics Msc rejected
University of Liverpool - Mathematics - Financial Mathematics Msc rejected
University of Glasgow - Finance - Quantitative Finance Msc rejected
University of Nottingham - Finance - Financial and Computational Mathematics Msc rejected



edit: I didnt apply to US schools because most require the GRE and I just didnt want to take the exam under such a short amount of time to meet the deadlines. Also I would prefer going abroad and discovering new places. I got into a couple schools. Quite happy about montreal because London (or any UK universities, so sorry Manchester :( ) would have been too tight financially.
Still waiting for McMaster cause I'm very interested by their Msc in Math.
McGill is very prestigious so I'm not hopeful, I neglected to consider it's one of the best Canadian Uni.

Anyway, next year i'm going to Canada, hope the weather won't be much worse than the midwest :D

Was never particularly happy with the physics GRE scores... took it twice. Got a 750 the first time. At least I broke 800. Took the regular GRE once, did not study.

Research Experience: Two years in Nuclear physics with highly reputable professor. One publication in Physics Letters B, one of many co-authors. Another two years in Medical physics (there was some overlap.) Pioneered several experiments in spin exchange optical pumping, one of which had some remarkable results. First author publication prepared and submitted to Physical Review Letters. Rejected by peer review for lack of a certain control (essentially.) It was in the "being prepared for resubmission" stage when I applied. Sending to Phys Rev A rapid communications next. Letter of Rec from Medical Physics prof should be very strong, as well as a letter from a postdoc in medical physics.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: American Nuclear Society Scholarship, Honorable Mention in Triangle Area DataFest 2014, SMIF Undergraduate research grant recipient (2 years), Dean's List for 3 or 4 semesters,

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Physics TA at johns hopkins CTY and in the physics department for a year. SPS Officer for a year or so.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Not that come to mind but I did make a typo in my SoP...

Special Bonus Points: Two grad classes completed by the time I applied. A- in both.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: One of my fall semester grades has a note "Changed from Incomplete" because I didn't quite finish work for an independent study in time. However it was changed to an A.

Undergrad Institution: University of Wisconsin-Madison, large state school, top 20 in physics, plasma focused
Major(s): Applied Math Engineering and Physics, Physics
Minor(s):
GPA in Major: 3.19
Overall GPA: 3.24
Length of Degree: 4.5 years
Position in Class: No idea, probably average
Type of Student: White male, protestant. (->Domestic)

GRE Scores : revised
Q: 162, 83%
V: 164, 92%
W: 4.0, 56%
P: 820, 74%

Research Experience: 18 months as a lab assistant in a quantum computing lab (machining and soldering, no interesting physics), 5 months working with X-ray diffraction group, numerical simulations, one publication, fourth author of twelve

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: none

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: nope

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Graduated with 3.238 but earned somewhat higher grades in upper division coursework; after 8 months out of school I came back as a special student in order to work for one of my professors from undergrad and take a pair of classes on lasers and nanophotonics. Earned A's in both, while doing research and working 30 hours a week in retail, and my publication came out of that as well, so I think that looked good in my statement of purpose. Last four semesters then look like 3.4, 3.4, 3.7, 4.0. Undergraduate major ended up with almost as much coursework in materials science as in physics, focused on electronic properties of materials and solid state physics, for a prospective focus in experimental condensed matter.

Special Bonus Points: the PI I work for now did his post-doc at Bell Labs, I don't know how if that gives his recommendation any extra weight, and I'm unsure of how prominent he is in his field.

Reflection:
I didn't sweep my applications, but being an international student with no legacy or connections, I was very happy with my results. The most surprising thing was that I didn't get into MIT physics after being picked up by Stanford and CalTech. I had a great match with a professor there and he said he recommended me to the admissions committee. Our program also has had a tradition of top students being admitted to MIT physics. You would think that a great match and a strong profile would get you into a top school like MIT, but now that I think about it, maybe luck is also an important aspect. Maybe also the lack of publications (because I was doing a lot of instrument development) played a factor in the east coast schools. At this point, I really don't know what the admissions committees (especially at MIT) are looking for, so take my advice below with a grain of salt.

I think that all the things that people mention as bonus points, such as famous recommenders, being female/minority, or great extra-curriculars, help maybe a bit at a subconscious level when the committee is reading your application. But you really shouldn't rely on them giving you an edge over anyone; you should instead focus on demonstrating you are capable of mastering a set of skills that is critical in a field. I had non-famous people writing probably-not-stellar letters, but I really pushed myself to master deposition and growth techniques, which are becoming increasingly important in all condensed matter experimental groups. People are building integrated MBE systems with literally everything from ARPES systems to STM system. I can now practically join any group and develop my interest in any technique because I have my sample growth background. Of course this is just one route you can follow, and this is my way. I'm sure there are many other ways to impress the admissions committee. But if you are a condensed matter experimentalist and have no idea which technique you would want to do, you can try following my footsteps. I think this can be generalized to other fields but I'm not familiar with them.

Undergrad Institution: Small public school (ranked 75th, solid reputation in physics for its size)
Major(s): Engineering Physics (curriculum not significantly different from ordinary physics degree)
Minor(s): 3.9
GPA in Major: 3.9
Overall GPA: 3.9
Length of Degree: 4
Position in Class: No idea ... near top?
Type of Student: Domestic white male

GRE Scores : revised
Q: 166 (92%)
V: 165 (95 %)
W: 5.5 (98%)
P: 850 (78%) eh good enough


Research Experience: One summer at Los Alamos National Laboratory (SULI program) and one summer at NIST Gaithersburg (SURF program), both in the AMO ballpark. Currently researching in the theoretical physics dept at my school (many-body/computational physics). Pending publication (although I did not mention it on applications).

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: None mentioned on applications.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Tutor for 3 years (ACT, AP classes), intern at National Instruments (very brief 3 months, got Los Alamos offer and quit)

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: None mentioned

Special Bonus Points: I got recommendations from two of the best professors in my dept. One of them, who I'm currently doing research for, is famous for his work in quantum simulation/many body physics. He's published over 100 papers and has given over 100 talks. He told me that he wrote me a very strong letter.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Transfer student (had a great GPA at that school too though, 3.95)

Applying to Where: For all of these schools, I signified AMO and condensed matter as my primary interests. All applications were for physics PhD.

UT Austin - 2/24 - Accepted (offered TA position, 18k/year)
CU Boulder - 3/1 - Rejected
UC Santa Barbara - 3/1 - Rejected
UC Berkeley - 3/7 - Rejected
UC San Diego - 3/5 - Rejected
University of Washington - 3/7 - Waitlisted
University of Michigan - Ann Arbor - 2/15 - Rejected
Georgia Tech - 2/24 - Accepted (offered TA position and fellowship, 35k/year)
Boston University - 3/1 - Rejected
Columbia - 2/26 - Rejected

Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with my results - I expected about 2-4 acceptances, so a 2.5/10 is more than good enough for me. Advice to future applicants: ask your advisor about underrated schools. You might get more love (in the form of fellowships :D).

Undergrad Institution: 1st in Canada, 20th overall. Very good reputation in Physics. Large research institution.
Major(s): Physics (Honours program)
GPA in Major: ~3.5 (4.0 in all last three semesters)
Overall GPA: 3.45 (2.7 in first year life sci program; 4.0 in all last three semesters)
Length of Degree: 4 years - took me 5 years because started out in life sci for 1.5 years
Position in Class:
Type of Student: White female; International (for US/Canada schools) - EU student (for UK schools)

GRE Scores : revised
Q: 162 (83%)
V: 163 (92%)
W: 4.0 (56%) :|
P: None - I did take it, and got sick about 20 minutes into the test. I had to leave the room, not able to come back. So my score is pretty much the lowest possible, but I attached an explanation for the few schools that required it (MIT, UC Boulder, Washington, UT Austin, and U of Hawaii). I assume they believed me, since it would be hard to get such a score otherwise. I wish I could have taken it a second time, but the very last sitting required me to go to the US and was the same day as a final exam I had :/ Best advice: even if you don't feel ready yet, do take the Physics GRE twice. Just do. It's worth it. You never know what could happen to bet such an important test on only one day. I'm just lucky that only a few schools required it and so it didn't completely kill my chances of going to grad school. I would probably have had to reapply the year after if I was only applying to physics/astronomy departments and not planetary.

Research Experience: Three research projects at my home institution with one of them major and directly related to my field of interest (paper in progress). One summer at NASA Ames with major project directly related to my field of interest (paper in review).

Publications: 1 publication in ApJ as 3rd author (unrelated to research interest), and 1 publication in review at PSS as 1st author (directly related to research interest). 1 paper in progress as 1st author, mentioned in recommendation letter.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: None

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: TA for first year physics (one semester)

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Minor: Vice-President of an astronomy club last year. Other diverse executive positions taken over the last 4 years.

Special Bonus Points: Two very good recommendations, by persons well-known in the field.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Specifically interested in astrobiology. Research experience very relevant to potential supervisors that I mentioned in applications and in some cases talked to by email.

Applying to Where: Focusing on Planetary Science departments or Astronomy. Applying to a LOT of schools as I was told it's a good idea if you're an international student...

Reach:

Caltech - Earth and Planetary Science - Rejected by email 02/12 :cry: :cry: My top choice :cry: :cry:
MIT - Earth and Planetary Science - Rejected by email 02/15
Oxford - EU student - Atmospheric Oceanic and Planetary Physics - Formal interview 02/29 - To future Oxford applicants: their interview was much harder than your usual grad school interview. Definitely must learn about all the physical concepts related to your future project even if you don't think you're expected to know them yet. - ACCEPTED by phone 03/03 - (16.5K lbs/year stipend)
Very, very BIG surprise given I did so, soooo bad on the interview (could not answer any of their questions and they seemed annoyed at me)!!! - Declined
U of Chicago - Geophysical Sciences - Informal "interview" 01/22 - ACCEPTED by email 02/02 - (86k/year in TA/RA incl. 50K tuition) :) - WILL ATTEND! :D
UC Berkeley - Earth and Planetary Science - Rejected by email indicating to check website 04/01
UCLA - Earth and Planetary Science - Waiting on advisor to see if he can support my application (no acceptances made without that)
Cambridge - EU student - Astronomy Masters - ACCEPTED by email 02/26 - Will decline

Match:

U of Toronto - Astronomy - Rejected by email 03/30 - thanks home institution..
U of Arizona - LPL - Rejected by email 03/04
UCSC - Earth and Planetary Science
UC Boulder - Astrophysical and Planetary Sci - Rejected by email 02/09
Penn State - Geosciences - Really good email exchanges with advisor - Informal "interview" with advisor 03/03 - ACCEPTED by email 03/07 - (18.5K stipend + 6K summer stipend) - Declined
U of Hawaii - Astronomy - Rejected by letter 02/26
U of Washington - Astronomy - Formal interview 02/17 - Waitlisted 02/26 on their "very small waitlist" lol
John Hopkins - Planetary Science
UT Austin - Astronomy - Formal interview 01/25 - Waitlisted 02/05 - Notification that the waitlist closed without any offers made to waitlisted students 04/08
U of Michigan - Atmospheric Oceanic and Planetary Sci - Withdrawn
Georgia Tech - Planetary Science - Rejected by email 04/05

Safety:

Florida Tech - Physics and Space Sci - ACCEPTED by email 03/02 - (15k $/9months stipend) - Declined
U of Victoria - Earth Sci - Informal interview with advisor 12/23 - ACCEPTED by email from advisor 02/11 - (16k $CAD/year stipend) - Declined
UC Riverside - Earth Sci - Email exchange with advisor indicates likely acceptance - Withdrawn


NOTE: I got rejected by all the schools where I hadn't contacted an advisor (except UChicago), and accepted by all the schools where I had contacted someone beforehand. It's VERY important to contact an advisor, unfortunately I learned that a lot of departments don't offer admission unless a faculty member supports your application, and they're much more likely to do that if you contact them. So future applicants, CONTACT ADVISORS :!: (even if you think you're a good match to the school and would get in)

Undergrad Institution: Private Liberal Arts University. No reputation in physics whatsoever (we are so understaffed we can't even create an undergrad curriculum with all the normal coursework!...but we are known for Law. Our Law School is best in the State, and our Governor is an Alum)
Major(s):Physics
Minor(s):nope
GPA in Major: I honestly I have no idea.
Overall GPA :3.43
Length of Degree: 4
Position in Class: We don't really do that.
Type of Student: Domestic white LGBT student, so there is that.

GRE Scores: revised
Q: 154
V: 156
W: 4.0
P: 600 (I know it sucks, but maybe if my school actually HAD statistical mechanics/thermodynamics coursework I'd be more prepared)


Research Experience: I have ZERO publications as of application time, but I did a project last summer with the Air Force Research Laboratory's Space Vehicles Directorate, am currently finishing the final draft of my honors thesis on conformal symmetries in Electroweak Symmetry Breaking that can explain Dark Energy if the Higgs is coupled to a dilaton field, and am doing a computational project on the explosive properties of Ball lightning.I hope to publish the latter two soon but that's too late for admissions.
Awards/Honors/Recognitions: The Air Force thing gave me the fancy title of "Phillips scholar" after General Samuel Phillips USAF and Director of the Apollo Program. I have a scholarship for Italian language studies, and am a member of Sigma Pi Sigma.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Well, I suppose my Research experience at the Air Force also counts as a job considering I was paid...

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: I am a member of the National Language Service Corps for my fluency in Italian, I was in an exchange program with the University of Bologna in Italy where i took and aced coursework on nuclear and particle physics IN ITALIAN, and attended the 4th Graduate Summer School on Complex Plasmas.

Special Bonus Points: I'm bi-gendered (like genderfluid but direct switch from male to female).

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I'm one of the few people in physics to want to get into National Security as a career, and made a point of doing that with nuclear stuff at Yale and GW. Yale in particular has an experiment I am IN LOVE WITH

Applying to Where:
Yale- Physics - Nuclear Exp.-Rejected 2/26 by email not surprised, but this was my top choice and still hurts :cry:
George Washington- Physics - Nuclear Exp.-Rejected 3/30 by email
Dartmouth- Physics - Cosmology-Rejected 4/6 by email
PSI-Rejected 4/7 by email
Lehigh-HETRejected 4/21 by email
UC Riverside HET Rejected 4/28 by email

Looking back, it appears the GRE is the gate keeper regardless of research experience or aptitude which I think is really stupid for a RESEARCH degree.

Undergrad Institution: Big State - Good Physics/Astro rep
Major(s): Astronomy/Physics
Minor(s):
GPA in Major: 3.95
Overall GPA: 3.90
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: N/A
Type of Student: Domestic white male

GRE Scores : revised
Q: 167 (94%)
V: 165 (95%)
W: 4.5 (80%)
P: 880 (83%)


Research Experience: Stellar Astrophysics Research on and off at home institution for 3 years. Summer REU 2015 leading to publication either first or second authorship (still in prep); presented this at AAS 227.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Physics and Astro dept. scholarships, university-wide scholarship, honor roll.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Astronomy club officer for 2 years; mentor for 3.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Nah

Special Bonus Points: Just one grad Astro class; though lots of elective undergrad classes like cosmology, GR, and advanced electro

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Was kind of in between looking at new fields during application process so that probably made me look pretty naive but ah well I thought everything tied together nicely :P also applied for the NSF

Applying to Where:

UC Berkeley - Astronomy - SNe/Cosmology - Rejected
Ohio State - Astronomy - SNe; Cosmology - Accepted Jan 6 by email. $26.5 or $29.5k pending University fellowship (Got the Fellowship!!) A letter writer was good friends with a committee member. Pains me to admit, but I probably wouldn't have gotten in without that.
Harvard - Astronomy - Cosmology - Rejected
UT Austin - Astronomy - Stellar Astronomy/binaries Rejected
UCLA - Physics & Astronomy - Rejected
Washington - Astronomy - Stellar Astronomy/binaries - Withdrew application
Chicago - Astronomy & Astrophysics - Cosmology Accepted Jan 28 by phone. $31.5k whoa! what an uplifting acceptance considering all the rejections. I guess my love for cosmology got through! So excited to visit.

For all you obsessive individuals like myself, go check out thegradcafe dot com for live news and stuff (this is where those probably rejections came from). Also the NRC rankings over at phds dot org are great to tinker with and use to throw your current choices into the gauntlet.

Takeaways:
Washington does things really late. Don't be surprised if you're already sold on another school before they even get back to you. Really strange application process they have going on there.

Departments seems to make pretty good choices for yourself if you're completely honest in your statement. I was rejected from schools I thought I would want to go to, but realized after that I didn't really fit in.

Go for good fits - schools you think may be safe schools can definitely reject you (none of my safer schools accepted me lol). From what I've been hearing, the increasing lack of "safety" at supposed safety school is also a result of an increasing number of overqualified applicants applying to a ridiculous number of schools.

Undergrad Institution: UCLA
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): Mathematics
GPA in Major: 4.00
Overall GPA: 3.89
Length of Degree: 4
Position in Class: Probably near top
Type of Student: Domestic white male

GRE Scores : revised
Q: 168 (95%)
V: 162 (90%)
W: 4.5 (80%)
P: 860 (80%)


Research Experience: Basically none besides the lab classes we take as part of the major.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Dean's List, Magna Cum Laude

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Started working full time as a Physicist out of college (graduated class of 2015, been working since a week after graduating)

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Nope.

Special Bonus Points: Probably have solid recommendations

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Probably not.

Applying to Where: In no particular order...

UCLA - HEP-ex unofficial admittance via email (invite to open house) - 2/11
CalTech - HEP-ex rejected via email - 2/12
MIT - HEP-ex rejected via website - 2/12
Stanford - HEP-ex rejected via email - 2/22
UCSD - HEP-ex rejected via email - 3/5
UCSB - HEP-ex rejected via email to check website - 2/29
UC Berkeley - HEP-ex accepted via email, financial info to come - 3/4 WHAT
University of Chicago - HEP-ex rejected via website - 2/19

Well, that's that! Amazing to get into Berkeley after all the rejections, but I suppose being a good fit with their program probably got me in. I have a feeling that I was actually on a waitlist, since I think the wave of acceptances went out a couple days before mine. If I had to do it all over again, I would have applied to more match/safety schools, because I was extremely close to having only rejections.

It is my time to give back to this lovely community!!

Undergrad Institution: One of the top Canadian schools. Good reputation in physics.
Major(s): Physics, Math
Minor(s):
GPA in Major: 3.8
Overall GPA: 3.7
Length of Degree: 6 (less than 1.5 years of Co-op)
Position in Class: No idea
Type of Student: International Female

GRE Scores : revised
Q: >160
V: >150 (ugh!)
W: >3.5 (ugh!)
P: >700 (UGH!)


Research Experience: Less than 1.5 years, 5 projects in 2 subfields, also have experience in a third subfield. 2 first-author pubs in 2 subfields, one more to come. 1 APS meeting, 2 local workshops, 1 summer school for grad students/ postdocs. 4 oral and poster presentations in total. 1 visiting student in a national lab of DOE.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Good grades scholarships, good student scholarships, summer student awards (1 nation-wide, several school-wide).

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Volunteering in a group since those people are awesome?

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: I have a Canadian Red Cross CPR-C certificate if that counts...

Special Bonus Points: Female. LoRs from professors from three different subfields. I think my referees are well connected, though ironically none of them is from my local physics department.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I am not particularly interested in any discipline (I like AMO, fine with nuclear while interested in learning about CMT) but in quantum mechanics in general, so it is tricky, and I know this research interest might kill me but carpe diem. And I switched major three times (biology -> XXX -> XXX -> physics + mathematics) if that counts...

Applying to Where: All physics dept., all few to many-body quantum theory in AMO/ CMT/ nuclear systems with preference in mathematical physics (I would've added particle if they start playing with multi-particle interactions)

US (All Ph.D.):
Harvard - Rejected 2/24 by email checking applyweb. Almost bye-bye Boston :|
MIT - Rejected 2/12 from website :(
Boston University - Accepted 2/12 by email with 5-year fellowship in the form of TA/RA :mrgreen:
Stony Brook - Waitlisted 2/16 by email after declining their MA (I really like their director who gave me his best wishes when I declined their MA offer! -- but I cannot afford the tuition plus living expense plus student fee, by the way it is 42k just in case someone is interested... :( )Rejected since it is past 4/15.
Columbia - Rejected 3/02 by email to check website. hmm...
Cornell - Rejected 2/15 by email (hurt less since this comes after having two rejections on 2/12)
Princeton - Rejected 2/22 by email. Not surprised... and I like their rejection letter.
Univ. Maryland, College Park - Accepted 2/17 by email, TAship + some sort of grant (So they really want me to do physics there!) :mrgreen: though not JQI fellow :oops:
CU Boulder - Accepted 1/26 by email with TAship + signing bonus (OMG this is GOOD!). Update Feb. 23: awarded another fellowship. :mrgreen:

UC Santa Barbara - Rejected 2/29 by email. Bye bye KITP.
Stanford - Rejected 2/22 by email. Not surprised... and a nicely written rejection letter.
Caltech - Rejected 2/12 by email :( and thank you for encouraging :shock:
Univ. Chicago - Rejected 2/19 by email. I do like the city :( :( :(
Univ. Washington, Seattle - Rejected 3/01 by email. One first author in nuclear physics is definitely not enough...

Canada (All Master):
Univ. British Columbia - Unofficial waitlist 3/03 by asking department staff. 3/06 heart broken, withdrawn
Univ. Toronto - Unofficial waitlist 2/28 by email from THE person I would like to work with in U of T. Interesting... :shock:Accepted 3/22 by email with offer letter. Scholarship - Tuition = ~ CAD 21k/yr.

Reflection:
Indeed, in order to get into named places, GPA, GRE, LoR and research experience (plus SoP) are all important. While a meh GRE would not be too bad a thing to cry about (I did when I received the score...), too low a score might kill the chance even with great other stuff. Also, having supportive letters is very important. I know that one of my letter was awesome, but I should have asked a fourth letter from maybe one of my course professors who knows me well too.
Moreover, I have to say that having undergraduate research experience is very, very important and rewarding. In my case, besides getting me into great places, it also helps me to decide what to study and trains me how to study a problem. Everyone has been telling me that a physics B. Sc. would train one the problem-solving skills but it was until I finished my first project did I realize why.
Lastly, I would like to thank this forum for being with me when I was suffering through my life crisis during the second half of my awful undergraduate yearsssss. You guys are great people! And to those who see this post in the future, just make the best of what you have, and you will not only survive this turbulent season, but also thrive it.
Once a decision is finalized, the past becomes merely a fine structure of the ground state, and everything restarts again.
Enough said.

Undergrad Institution: Small liberal arts university in the USA. No real reputation in physics (some reputation in space science)
Major(s):Physics- Area of concentration in astrophysics, Mathematics
Minor(s): None
GPA in Major: 3.74 in physics, 4.0 in math
Overall GPA: 3.83
Length of Degree: Four years
Position in Class: No idea, probably near top
Type of Student: Domestic minority male

GRE Scores : Revised
Q:153(52%)
V:149(41%) though I took it once before and got a 152(54%)
W:4.0(56%)
P:590(26%)

If you couldn't tell, I'm an incredibly poor standardized test taker (my ACT sucked in high school too).




Research Experience: I've been doing research at my university for four years. First year was making observations using our 21 meter radio dish of blazars and supernova remnants and reducing the data to determine flux densities at various frequencies to determine spectral indices (we wanted to test the capabilities of our instrument and compare our numbers with published results). This research was presented via a poster at the 2013 summer AAS conference. Next I did data reduction and analysis of supernova remnants and blazars at x-ray frequencies using the Chandra and Swift observatories. Worked on a galaxy that lead to a co-authorship on a published paper in the astronomical journal. Participated in an REU at the University of Chicago last summer working in CMB cosmology (more experimental and analysis). Presented work I've been doing on a blazar at the Swift conference last October (which is also my senior thesis).

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: None

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Student research assistant, tutored one semester in physics.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: None

Special Bonus Points: Currently taking a two week class on AGN in Gottingen, Germany. One of the people who wrote a letter of recommendation for me just won a prize for his CMB studies (at U.Chicago), if that counts.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Hmmm not really.

Applying to Where: All in astrophysics unless otherwise stated

University of Kentucky- Accepted! via email, GTA $17,000/yr and possible $3000 summer support during the first year (Declined)
University of Louisville - Accepted! via email, GTA $22,000 over 12 months (Declined)
University of Tennessee Knoxville - Accepted! via email to check website, GTA $21,000 over 12 months - WILL ATTEND!
University of New Mexico - Rejected via email
University of Arizona - Rejected via email
University of Florida (Botched this one terribly during the application process, likely rejected)
Florida State University (Will likely be rejected as they already made their target number of offers round one)
Ohio State University - Rejected via email
Pennsylvania State University - Rejected via email
University of Chicago - Rejected (I thoroughly expected that so no biggie)

I understand that U.Chicago is a MASSIVE stretch but I figured "why not?" since I did an REU there and apparently did a very good job.
Anyways, seems like research experience goes a long way too. EDIT: Turns out I was right, massive stretch. I suspect I'll hear back from one of the other schools sometime next week.

Been a pretty stressful process for me. Didn't get into any of my top choices but still got three offers and my life won't stagnate after undergrad. Physics GRE scores (and GRE scores in general) matter, but research experience also goes a pretty long way. Life is good.

Undergrad Institution: Big state school, top 25 in physics.
Major(s): Physics (Optics specialization)
Minor(s): Mathematics
GPA in Major: 3.96
Overall GPA: 3.86
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: near top
Type of Student: Domestic Male

GRE Scores : Revised
Q: 164/88%
V: 156/71%
W: 5.0/93%
P: 680/46%

Research Experience: 3.5 years of AMO research in a laser cooling lab at home institution. One summer of Bose-Einstein condensate research at a top 5 institution(Harvard). Presented posters at multiple national meetings.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Dean's List, Undergraduate Recognition award for extracurricular achievement (research/clubs etc.), travel grant for presenting at a national conference.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: One semester TAing for intro classical mechanics, SPS chapter VP for 3 years.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Grad student at home institution who I worked with was often absent due to medical/mental troubles, so I had the chance to work a lot on my own on the experiment and gain a lot of important experience and responsibility. I believe my primary adviser wrote about this in his letter.

Special Bonus Points: My research advisor at my home school is an older, very well known and respected physicist in AMO. I also worked with a younger, but very accomplished physicist at an Ivy League institution (Harvard) for my summer project after my junior year. They both wrote recommendation letters for me. I was able to take a grad class on Ultracold Atoms and Quantum Gases (BEC) and multiple advanced courses (Laser, Adv. Quantum, Solid State) in my first semester of senior year which showed up on my transcript.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: MIT is the only school that asked for my Fall 2016 grades. I took 4 advanced PHY courses including one grad class along with studying for PGRE, and I ended up getting 1 A and 3 B+'s in PHY courses that semester which brought my PHY GPA down to 3.87. Could be why I was waitlisted, but even then I was surprised I wasn't rejected outright.

In my SOP I mentioned this heavy workload, along with my desire to focus on research during the summer of my junior year to partially explain why my PGRE score was so low. I mentioned that I would rather learn real physics than focus on some multiple choice exam. I think my letters of recommendation were very strong and they echoed this sentiment of my focus on research and learning over exam scores. My main adviser said that he would write in his letter of recommendation that admissions committees should outright ignore my PGRE score since my grades and research speak for themselves.

Applying to Where:

Home Institution - Physics - AMO experiment-----Was virtually accepted by my research advisor, but told that if I got in somewhere else better that they want me to go away and would rather give my offer to someone else who they wanted from another school. Luckily that's what occurred. :)

U Rochester - Physics - AMO experiment-----Accepted 1/25, 19k 9 mo., up to 26k per year-----Visited the school. Good AMO research, but I wasn't overly impressed. More of a focus on Optics; the Atomic physics is good but as my mentor said is a little past it's prime at this institution.
Cornell - Physics - AMO experiment-----Accepted 2/12, 27k 9 mo., up to 31-35k per year-----Surprised to get in. They have good but few AMO people.

CU Boulder - Physics - AMO experiment-----Accepted 2/15, 19k 9 mo., up to 27-31k per year, 1k signing bonus----- Was ecstatic to hear this. My professors shook my hand after I told them the good news. Seems like the best research fit and best place to live. WILL ATTEND

U Virginia - Physics - AMO experiment-----Accepted 2/24, 20k 9 mo., 25.6k first year-----More of a backup for me, even considering home institution.
U Michigan Ann Arbor - Physics - AMO experiment-----Accepted 3/4, 29.8k per year-----I had assumed I was rejected because it took so long, so this was a nice surprise. I think they were just overwhelmed with the number of qualified applicants this year. I actually didn't send them my low PGRE scores as they do not require but "strongly recommend them"... although I forgot to remove the part in my SOP trying to explain low GRE scores because of my focus on research and large course load instead of the exam... I guess it worked out in the end.

UMD College Park - Physics - AMO experiment-----Waitlisted 2/21----- -----Rejected 4/11
Entire waiting list was "released" during the last week. They expressed how excited they were about their incoming students and that they had no room for more, not exactly humble or professional. I got into better schools anyway.

MIT - Physics - AMO experiment-----Waitlisted 2/16----- -----Rejected 4/13
Even after an interview with the head of the Atomic Physics group I ended up being rejected from the waiting list with two days left. Made choosing Boulder very easy. Boulder seems like a better fit anyway since it's also a top AMO school without all the extra pressure.

U Chicago - Physics - AMO experiment-----Rejected 2/19
Harvard - Physics - AMO experiment-----Rejected 2/24
This one hurt at first, since I spent the previous summer there. Was hoping my strong research fit and connections would help them overlook my low PGRE. I talked to my adviser from my summer project at Harvard and he mentioned that he just didn't have room in his group to add a student this year, which he warned me about in the past. Perfectly understandable. Boulder seemed to be a somewhat better fit in any case, due to the atmosphere.
Yale - Physics - AMO experiment-----Rejected 2/26
Columbia - Physics - AMO experiment-----Rejected 2/26
Penn State - Physics - AMO experiment-----------Rejected 4/5
Got a rejection email in my spam folder, didn't notice until 3 days later. The status of my application on my account on their website was updated with REJECTED in big, bold, red letters. Not very professional.

Undergrad Institution: State University, no rep for physics
Undergraduate Major(s): Physics
GPA in Major: 3.34
Overall GPA: 3.11
Type of Student: Domestic White Male

GRE Scores:
Q: 155 (60%)
V: 155 (67%)
W: 3.5 (38%)
P: 500 (9%) (obligatory :oops:)

Research Experience:

Three years instrumentation on a significant NSF-funded project; one publication, one poster.

One year working on a globular cluster project; one publication, one poster.

Currently working as a research scientist at GSU, the only school I'm applying to. The instrumentation research I did led to me connecting with GSU faculty, who we began collaborating with. Moved to Atlanta and started working at the end of the summer, 2015.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs:

Tutored physics to the youngins' at my school, did generic lab work/repair work for the physics department. Presentations regarding my research for the Physics Club, and I've represented the Physics department at a number of university events. Tutored online for a few months.

Other Information:

Major coursework such as E&M, Classical and Quantum came way later in my studies than they should have, after I took my PGRE. Also worked 30+ hours a week (plus research) for most of my college career.

Applying to Where:

Was rejected from most of my schools last year (applied before I was published), so I held out and took a good opportunity working at a university I want to go to.

Georgia State University - Astronomy PhD - Requested for interview 2/12 - Interviewed 2/17 - Accepted February 26th! Awaiting financial details

Life is good.

Research Experience: Two research projects in CMT at home institution, one for 2.5 years (and one summer), another for 1.5 years. One summer research fellowship abroad, also in CMT. No publications at time of application, but two papers in preparation: one first author of three, another fourth author of five. Also a handful of conference talks and poster presentations.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Top undergraduate research award at home institution, completed a thesis early and earned highest level of distinction, dean's list all semesters.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Tutor/TA for several different physics and math courses over a span of three years. Spent a summer designing and teaching my own science class.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Nah.

Special Bonus Points: Four grad classes (three physics, one math), a few A+'s. Recommenders aren't too well-known, but I think all of the letters were strong.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:

Applying to Where: Applying for CMT at all schools. Applying with a partner, hence the large number of schools.

While I am thrilled with these results, my rejections put me in a position to offer a word of advice to any future applicants interested in studying theory at top schools: Unless you are exceptionally well-qualified, a high GRE score (~950+) generally seems necessary for admittance to top 5 programs. Of course, I can't know this with certainty, but the fact that I was rejected from all the top 5 programs to which I applied, and admitted nearly everywhere else with a few fellowships, seems to support this conclusion.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: 2 papers, one in CMT. (See Research Experience).

Special Bonus Points: Took 4 graduate physics classes in undergrad and did well.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I had applied to graduate schools for HET last year, with no research experience in theory, and was rejected at all but my safety schools. I decided to take a year off to do research in CMT and apply again. I learned a ton and it definitely had a big impact on my admissions this time around.

Applied to Where:

MIT - Physics- CMT - Accepted
Harvard - Physics- CMT - Rejected
UIUC - Physics- CMT - Accepted
Yale - Physics- CMT - Rejected
Princeton - Physics- CMT - Rejected
Stanford - Physics- CMT - Rejected

Undergrad Institution: Ivy League (But not one of the 2 people care a lot about)
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): Math, Economics (both are actually most of the way to majors)
GPA in Major: 4.00 (~half A+)
Overall GPA: 3.95
Length of Degree: 4 yrs
Position in Class: Presumably top
Type of Student: White Domestic Male (Foreign born in Europe but naturalized)

GRE Scores:
Q: 170 (98%)
V: 170 (99%)
W: 6.0 (99%)
P: 990 (94%) (Conquering the Physics GRE is a great book)

Research Experience:

2 years solidstate/biophysics work. Equal first author publication in ~15 impact factor journal. APS and BPS talk and poster.
2 years soft matter work. Getting close to publication, senior honors thesis on the way. Had to pull out of an APS talk because of scheduling issues. Whoops.
1 summer REU at top physics school doing nanophotonics and solid state. Will eventually be a minor author on a few publications.

Also 1 year in high school doing computational nanobiology work. Don't think that mattered at all.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Deans list and finalist for goldwater twice.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Nothing really. Started a small company that folded before it really took off. Learned a ton from that.

Special Bonus Points: Took 5 graduate physics classes out of my field (mostly cosmology and GR stuff). Did well and really enjoyed them.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Teach a class of third graders about science as part of a teaching program. Tons of tutoring experience. I know that at least two of the letters are absolutely glowing, and the third likely emphasized my pretty novel NSF proposal concept which was entirely my idea.

Applied to Where:
All CME with focus on spintronics/quantum materials.

MIT: Waitlisted Probably means rejected. Had an interview that simply didn't go well. Not a disaster but no connection. But two hour plus long technical interviews later I'm in. Accepted
MIT DMSE: Accepted
Harvard: Accepted Attending
Cal Tech: Accepted
Berkeley: Accepted
Stanford Applied physics: Rejected Made a mistake on my SOP. Oh well.
Princeton: Accepted
Chicago: Accepted
UCSB: Accepted After a really fun interview.

NSF GRFP Awarded

And then a few safeties which I'll decline to list.

I spent way too much time stressing out about stuff over the last couple of years. I definitely didn't expect this level of outcome. Hopefully someone will look at my background and see that you don't need to be Einstein to get good results. Just do good work, do well in your classes, study for the GRE, and make sure you get along with your research team and everything will be ok.

Undergrad Institution: USNWR Top 30. Pretty mediocre overall rank in physics, but strong in condensed matter.
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): Math
GPA in Major: 3.94
Overall GPA: 3.89
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: Top 5%
Type of Student: Domestic White Male

GRE Scores : Revised
Q: 167 (94%)
V: 163 (92%)
W: 4.5 (80%)
P: 890 (84%)

Research Experience:
- 3 years doing CME research at home institution - 1 publication (4th author), a few posters, and a contributed talk at the APS March Meeting.
- REU at Columbia

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Sigma Pi Sigma, Dean's list every semester, a few other awards for being a good student.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: SPS President for 2 years, Sigma Pi Sigma President for 1 year, a few different leadership positions in the residence hall association.

Special Bonus Points: A couple grad classes, letter from my PI at Columbia. I also have a lot of experience in materials synthesis which apparently is a rare and pretty attractive skill.

Applying to Where: All CME

Stanford - Rejected 2/22 via email
Harvard - Rejected 2/24 via website
MIT - Rejected 2/22 via website
Princeton - ACCEPTED!!!! 2/22 via email - (~$34K stipend)
Columbia - Rejected 3/22 via website (A little surprised just because of all the connections I had, but I guess it's kinda nice to see that personal connections don't carry as much weight as people often say they do)
UMD - Withdrew application after getting into Princeton
Johns Hopkins - Accepted 1/21 via email (Special Fellowship so I don't have to TA that comes with $25K stipend for 9 months + $5,000 research fund)
Northwestern - Interview 1/19 - Accepted 1/27 via website (~$30K stipend)

This whole process really is a crap shoot. For most of the year my plan was to go to MIT and if I didn't get in, Columbia, where I thought my having done an REU there and having a rec from a prominent faculty member would make me a shoo in. As you can see, I didn't get into either, but I did get into Princeton where I never thought I'd have a chance. I guess my main piece of advice would be to apply to a lot of schools (probably more than I did and probably with a few real safeties) just cause these sorts of decisions are so hard to predict. I also noticed that I seemed to better at the schools where I did not say in my personal statement who my first choice for an advisor would be.

TAKE AWAY: FOR INTERNATIONAL MALES, aim for perfect GRE (both general and specially PGRE) scores. Don't even look at the profiles of Domestic applicants specially those of females while shortlisting the grad schools, these profiles are highly deceptive. It doesn't matter if you have published papers at top venues and have good research experience, if you are an international male having average PGRE then you will survive mostly all the rejection rounds but will get rejected off the waitlist in the end no matter what (maybe because of limited funding for international students). Contact professors before applying, helps a lot in at least reserving a place in wait-listed applicants. Also apply for M.S programs at other places (Europe and Canada) if you can afford, I did not hoping that I am a strong applicant and will get a PhD position at one of the schools I applied to but here I am searching for jobs now. Also, order your score reports more than a month in advance as in my case ETS took more than 40 days to send official score reports to the requested universities thus delaying the completion of application and in some cases it was completed much after the deadline which might be the reason why I was waitlisted even at universities supposed to be my 'safety schools'. In short, ETS sucks! Period!. Graduate admissions in US is a huge gamble so try to buy 'luck' if possible.

What follows is a byzantine story of a very unconventional student trying to get into programs they should not have. This is to give hope to all the homies who are intimidated by what they see here and maybe scared away from applying as a result. If I did this, you DEFINITELY can. Good luck.

Undergrad Institution: Top 30 in Physics
Major(s): Mathematics
Minor(s): Physics
GPA in Major: 3.4 Math/3.6 Physics
Overall GPA: 3.0
Length of Degree: 5.5
Position in Class: Average probably
Type of Student: Domestic White Male

GRE Scores : (revised or old version?)
Q: 168
V: 167
W: 4.0 (lol oh ok)
P: 880*

*Started at a 600, so this is a goddamn miracle. I never took stat mech, mech 2, EM 2 or quantum in undergrad, but self-taught what I needed via the conventional undergrad texts and of course Conquering the Physics GRE - go buy it now. do it. why are you still reading this. Studying for 10 hours a week for 2 months did the trick.



Research Experience: Abso-fucking-lutely nothing. Had a professor with whom I lined up a project but had no time between school and running a company full-time.

To be clear: I have NO business applying to physics PhD programs. I was a mediocre student in undergrad, didn't even major in physics, and have NO research experience. However, I have good test scores and some pretty sweet job experience that I sold like hell in statements of intent.


Awards/Honors/Recognitions: My parents think I'm pretty cool

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Worked for a prominent education company in the city of my university. Started as what was supposed to be a very part-time undergraduate assistant and tutor, but worked up to Head of Physics Dept and given a salary and equity a year before I finished my Bachelor's. The work was something like a hybrid recitation section and lecture. I taught ~50% of the intro physics students every semester. Everyone in the phys dept knows this company because of their prominence and some even know me because of my management role there.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: I once got a concussion from crashing on a longboard and my face breaking the fall. So, in short, no.

Special Bonus Points: I guess my math degree is probably the best non-physics degree one could have. Did well in all the calcs, algebras, and a calcs. Also took complex analysis.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Nope

Applying to Where: All CMT PhD

NYU - Rejected last week of February
Rochester - Rejected last week of February
Shitty directional school in my state - Rejected last week of February

At this point, having a weak resumé and having been rejected so EARLY from all of these schools, I figured the dream was dead. I applied to a few jobs in Silicon Valley (had some interviews and offers) and got ready to move my career in that direction. Then,

[Undergrad institution] - Accepted last week of April (~25k) - Crying, dancing, screaming, and attending


To summarize, if you really want to do something, you should do it. There is a place for everyone willing to put enough effort into the process. I spent several months studying for the PGRE because I knew that would be my strength. If you suck at tests but have spare time in undergrad, spend a bunch of time in a lab getting research exp. Also, I emailed every physics prof I had in undergrad asking for help/guidance/letters of rec, so at the very least, there were people in the dept who would remember my name when my app came up.

I was the last one in. Now I will spend the next 5 years proving they made the right decision. Thank you for all your help, you beautiful, brilliant people.

Finally getting around to this.

Undergrad Institution: Large state school in SW. Good physics reputation, but small dept.
Major(s): Physics, Math, Economics
Minor(s): N/A
GPA in Major: 4.0
Overall GPA: 4.0
Length of Degree: Took me 5 years for three BS degrees
Position in Class: Top
Type of Student: DWF

Grad Institution: JHU
Major(s): Biophysics MS
Minor(s): N/A
GPA in Major: 4.0

Grad Institution: Oxford
Major(s): Economics MS
Minor(s): N/A
GPA in Major: No GPAs, graduate with distinction

(yes, I did two masters degrees--don't ask me why)

GRE Scores :
Q: 161
V: 167
W: 6
P: 780



Research Experience: Lots. All four years of undergrad did an internship at a national lab. Couple of papers from my first masters, working paper at oxford plus thesis. A lot of applied math work, materials engineering, CM, etc.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: NSF Graduate fellowship at JHU, full ride to Oxford, St Gallen award, a lot of other smaller awards.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: TA'd a few classes, passed a qualifying exam in materials engineering.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Started a business in undergrad that I ended up selling.

Special Bonus Points: First gen college grad (not that it matters for grad school), female in STEM, worked with my recommenders one on one to write my recommendations (this was big for me because my GRE scores were low and I made sure each letter highlighted something much different)

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I'm older, 5 years to graduate & 3 of grad school already--some faculty want seasoned students and others want fresh young minds so it can go either way.

Applying to Where:

Harvard University - SEAS - AP/AM (CMT / Optics): Accepted
Caltech - Applied Physics - AP/CMT: Rejected
Columbia University - AM/AP - Accepted
Cornell - AP/CMT - Rejected
Cal Berkeley - AS&T/Materials Engineering - Accepted
Princeton University - SEAS/AP - Just Throwing My Money Away Because FI. Rejected
Columbia University - AM/AP - Accepted


Take aways. PhD programs seem to be pushing more and more for students to get one (even sometimes two) masters degrees before even entering their PhD. Degree inflation, push for maturity--call it whatever you want. For me this worked out well. I'm 31 and will get to attend my top choice program. My GRE scores sucked and this didn't seem to matter compared to fit, letters of rec, and research experience. Just another piece of data showing how little that exam means if you have solid materials in the rest of the app. For my first masters I got letters from my undergrad professors and was rejected everywhere but where I ended up attending, in retrospect this was probably my achilles heel. I didn't know them well and I don't think they put that much effort into them. If you want to make sure you get good letters BE INVOLVED FOR THE LOVE OF GAUSS! There is an outline about how to go about doing this. http://www.howtogetintograduateschool.c ... mendation/

Lastly, if you're applying to a saturated field like CMT, my experience has shown that adding more "trendy" ancillary topics of interest to your SoP and CV can go a long way. The overlap between CMT / Bio / Engineering / Applied Math is pretty substantial and grants/funding are easier to find in the latter options, but you're often allowed to do essentially the same research in the end. Just something to think about. Good luck to all!

Edit: After reading some of the other posts I have this to add--no matter what gender you are, if you're applying to US schools as an international students, yes your GRE scores have to be higher. This isn't about "limited funding for internationals" or "discrimination" --it's because every person on an admissions committee at every school doesn't spend all their free time traveling the globe to verify the credibility of foreign degrees. Your undergrad school may be the shit--but it isn't accredited in the US so they have no way of knowing that. The only objective way to judge your ability to do well, and to mill through thousands of international applicants, is to look at GRE scores because the test is consistent no matter where you take it. If they wanted to "discriminate" they'd simply educate US citizens and stop giving stipends and funding to people from other countries...instead around 50% of grad students in the US are foreign--but the money paying for those students comes from US taxpayers, keep that in mind. If you can find other ways to prove yourself to a committee (by getting US issued awards or being recognized by an international standard of some kind) this rule gets loosened a lot. I say this as someone who literally worked on a Dean search committee for 6 months at a Top 5 US University.
