Undergrad Institution: Truman State (Physics), Missouri S&T (Aero)
Major(s): Physics and Aerospace Engineering
Minor(s): Math
GPA in Major: 3.94 (AE) 3.93 (Physics)
Overall GPA: 3.80
Length of Degree: 5.5 years. I transferred and got two nearly unrelated degrees, so it took a bit longer...
Position in Class: I'd imagine near the top for both.
Type of Student: Domestic white male

GRE Scores (revised/old version):
Q: ?
V: ?
W: ?
P: ?


Research Experience: Nope. This will probably be my biggest weakness.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Just the usual scholarships and the like.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Tutored for 3 years and was a TA for a freshman level Physics course. For Aerospace I was a member of a design team for two years.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Can't think of any right now.

Special Bonus Points: Two of my rec letters for Aero are graduates from VT. Sadly, my Physics rec letters aren't very well connected. Truman's faculty is full of professors who want to teach, not do research. A couple of graduate level computational courses in AE, should crossover well for both applications.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Very strong record in two STEM fields, probably would help more if I was applying to interdisciplinary fields. I think that my AE degree will hurt my chances at Physics, whereas my Physics degree won't affect my Aero chances at all.

Applying to Where:
Tenitive Lists. I already have a job offer as an engineer, so I'm aiming a little high and if I don't get in, it's not the end of the world.

Physics:
Maryland - Physics - Physics Education
Colorado - Physics - Physics Education
Illinois - Physics - Physics Education
Ohio State - Physics - Physics Education
Missouri - Physics - Undecided

Aerospace Engineering:
Georgia Tech - Aerospace - Aerodynamics
Virginia Tech - Aerospace - Aerodynamics
Maryland - Aerospace - Aerodynamics
Illinois - Aerospace - Aerodynamics
Texas - Aerospace - Aerodynamics

Undergrad Institution: Big state school, top 20 physics
Major(s): Physics
GPA in Major: >3.0
Overall GPA: ~3.0
Length of Degree: 6 yrs (two transfers)
Position in Class: probably average
Type of Student: domestic male hispanic

GRE Scores (revised/old version):
Q: 160/760 (81%)
V: 158/580 (77%)
W: 4.0 (49%)
P: awaiting score (practice tests ~700, 56%)

Research Experience: Biophysics lab (currently, 1 yr so far, working on senior thesis), computational plasma (full summer), Heavy ion collision (couple of months), oncology microbio lab (full summer, over 5 yrs ago).

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: NSF undergrad funding recipient, sigma pi sigma inductee, SPS officer for a year, Honor Roll, and Dean's List for a few semesters, Terry Scholar for two years (full tuition and living scholarship).

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: equivalent of undergrad TA for non-science-major physics, tutored math & physics, student grader/assistant for intro physics.

Special Bonus Points: minority status, my research advisor (letter of rec) pioneered photonic force microscopy, for whatever that's worth. Also, er, computer skills (Fortran, java, unix CLI, mathematica, latex)?

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Particularly weak grades for the first few semesters.

Applying to Where: my tentative list, in order of descending US News' physics ranking. Currently trying to shorten my list.

(All Biophysics unless otherwise specified)
UC Berkeley
Cornell
UC Santa Barbara
Columbia
UC San Diego
UT Austin
UC LA
UCol Boulder
UWash Seattle
UC Davis
Georgia Tech
UC Irvine - Math, Comp, & Systems Bio.
UArizona
NYU
UC Santa Cruz
ASU

It seems that a lot of schools have separate PhD programs for biophysics. My hope is that they are easier to get into than the straight physics programs because they are probably less popular amongst undergrad physics students applying to grad programs. Also, a lot of these programs are interdisciplinary, accepting apps from bio, chem, eng, phys undergrads. This may give me an advantage? It should be obvious that I am smarter than anyone with a lesser science degree, right?

Undergrad Institution: Top 5 LAC
Major(s): Physics
GPA in Major: 3.28
Overall GPA: 3.14
Type of Student: white male

Grad Institution: Unknown State School
Major(s): Mechanical Engineering (CFD)
GPA: 3.35
GPA after first term 3.62

GRE Scores
Q: 168 (97%)
V: 166 (96%)
W: 5.0 (92%)
P: 870 (83%)

Research Experience: 3 projects over 4 years, all computational

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Dept. Honors, Sigma Xi

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Some grad classes in Statistical Physics.

Special Bonus Points: Recs should be speak to a variety of different strengths (might not even sound like the same person?)

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Undergrad GPA is low in the middle, high on the ends. Doesn't look too good. Grad GPA is pulled down by one terrible undergrad class I thought I should take.

Applying to Where:
All Condensed Matter Theory

U Chicago Rejected via e-mail 3/1
U Maryland Rejected via e-mail 4/10
U Colorado Rejected via e-mail 2/25
U Michigan Rejected via e-mail 2/12
U Washington Rejected via e-mail 3/13
Brown Accepted via e-mail on 2/21 with TA 22.2 k/9 months +2.5k/month for summer !!! Will Attend! 4/6
Northwestern Rejected via check of website 4/21
Carnegie Mellon Rejected via e-mail 4/25
Boston U Rejected via e-mail 2/14
NYU Rejected via e-mail 3/12
Northeastern Accepted on 2/28 via e-mail with TA 30 k / year Declined 4/6
Brandeis Invited to open house via e-mail on 1/29 Declined 2/22
Illinois at Chicago Withdrawn 2/28 Accepted Anyway on 3/1 via e-mail with TA $15,570 / 9 months
U Connecticut Accepted on 2/12 via e-mail with TA 20.4 k / year Declined 2/22

Comments: If I could do it again, I would have shaved off some of the reach schools that I had less positive e-mail correspondences with (i.e. Maryland) and maybe a backup (i.e. Illinois at Chicago) and replaced them with a selection from Johns Hopkins, Duke, UCSD, UCI, Virginia, Penn based on the enthusiasm of e-mail correspondence with professors. I also tried to correspond/list 3 professors in each application, but in retrospect this was too much. I would have focused on 1 or 2 professors except in rare circumstances. I am not surprised by the acceptance at Brown/ rejection elsewhere in the top 50. The school seemed a good match for my personal statement / the video segment of their app (which everyone but me seemed to be complaining about) and my background resonated with some specific projects. Don't let a low undergrad GPA deter you from applying to schools. Work hard for the tests and work to widen your net of quality/terse e-mail correspondences like it's a full time job, especially if your background and skill set are relatively unusual. In addition, I would like to echo the comment posted on the profile below about the PGRE, which is that based on the practice exams I expected to score in the upper 900's and was blindsided by a much lower score. The scoring on the practice exams, especially the older ones, is probably much softer than the tests which are now given, beware!

Undergrad Institution: St Andrews University (Scotland!) Fairly good for physics
Major(s): Theoretical Physics and Mathematics
Minor(s):
GPA in Major: Doing some conversions it seems to be 3.91
Overall GPA: 1st class (3.87)
Length of Degree: 4 years, but it's a Masters i'll have a the end.
Position in Class: Not the top but not too far off hopefully.
Type of Student: International white male

GRE Scores (revised):
Q: 168 (97%)
V: 166 (96%)
W: 4.5 (73%)
P: 800 (74%) Very disappointed with this :(


Research Experience: One REU at Montana State University working on solar physics, one summer in St Andrews working on condensed matter theory. Both times my worked seemed to be more than satisfactory. No publications though, wasn't really feasible with what I was doing in the time frame (I tell myself).

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Just deans list 2 out of 3 years

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: I have no idea what sps, ta etc mean so i'll assume not.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Nothing physics related really.

Special Bonus Points: The professor I worked with at MSU did has PhD at one of the places i'm applying. Will have taken 6 Graduate level courses and a masters project if that helps?

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I have taken more credits than I needed to and at a higher level.

Applying to Where: Mostly for CMT apart from Montana State

Stanford - Rejection
Cornell - Rejection 02/12
University of Washington - Rejection
Universirty of Michigan - Rejection 02/12
University of Colorado Boulder - Rejection
Princeton - Rejection
Montana State University (for solar) - Acceptance Declined
Harvard - Rejection
Berkeley - Rejection
MIT - Rejection
University of Wisconsin Madison - Acceptance 01/24
University of Chicago - Rejection

Gotta say, I'm fairly pessimistic after receiving my Physics GRE score, can definitely see myself getting rejected by pretty much everywhere.

Edit - So as expected rejected from almost everywhere. Fairly disappointed, but my PGRE really is just too low. I would advise anyone if possible to try and sit it twice, however confident you are. I thought i'd get 950+ (aiming for 990) and I have no idea how I didn't given how confident I was after the test but hey it happened.

Undergrad Institution: Military Service Academy
Overall Reputation in Physics? None, huge engineering reputation
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s):
GPA in Major: 3.86
Overall GPA: 3.4

Position in Class: top 20%
Type of Student: Domestic white male

GRE Scores (revised/old version):
Q: 770 83%
V: 520 61%
W: 4.0 49%
P: April 2012: 680 51% October 2012: 720 59%


Research Experience: (At your school or elsewhere? What field? How much time? Any publications (Mth author out of N?) or conference talks etc...)
Undergrad
Variable star and exoplanet observation, modeling and simulation 1 year- one conference poster
Government DoD Laboratory
Remote sensing/spectroscopy 1.5 years- One conference publication as a second author/Master's Thesis
Fuel Cell research involving spectroscopy 2 years- Submitted publications: second author in JACS, first author in PChem C. Poster presentation at American Chemical Society National Meeting.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: In-house research of the Quarter award

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: (Such as tutor, TA, SPS officer etc...) Government laboratory scientist for 4+ years

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

Special Bonus Points: Have a MS in Applied Physics GPA 3.56, conecentration was lasers and spectroscopy. Beam time at Argonne National Laboratory's Advanced Photon Source.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: As a military officer, my job was to conduct and manage research at a government laboratory. Most of my research was in electrochemistry but I hope the duration (4+ years) and responsibility ($Ms in portfolio) of my position shows a general competence in research. However, I have also been out of academia for a while now.
Also, I have a little bit lower GPA than I would like. This is somewhat due to the large core curriculum and type of classes that factored into my GPA like unarmed combat, water survival, and military tactics classes that I did not always get an A in.

Applying to Where: Plan to do astrophysics research at each institution. Preferably in galactic or extragalactic evolution/dynamics, cosmology, or high energy astrophysics.

Minnesota-Astro - Accepted via email 24 Jan Will attend.
UNC-Physics - Accepted via email 1 Feb
Kansas-Physics - Accepted via email 11 Feb
Illinois-Astro - Wait Listed via email 7 March- Withdrawn

Undergrad Institution: Top 1 or 2 in Canada for physics
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): -
GPA in Major: >4.0/4.0
Overall GPA: 4.0/4.0
Length of Degree: 5 years because of a brief/misguided foray into engineering
Position in Class: Top
Type of Student: white Canadian male

GRE Scores (revised/old version):
Q: 168 (97%)
V: 164 (93%)
W: 4.5 (73%)
P: 870 (83%) - I underestimated the relative importance of a perfect PGRE

Research Experience: Two years of real research - 1 year in theoretical/simulation biophysics; 1 year working with a particle theorist on the dynamics & deconfinement transition of certain gauge theories and by simulating spin models that are dual to the gauge theories. My supervisor is relatively well known in the hep-th community so hopefully this bodes well. This work resulted in a paper that has been published in JHEP. I'm also doing a Higgstrahlung decay analysis throughout this school year, and am continuing my work with the particle theorist on a project about the symmetries of moebius fermions with yukawa couplings (related to regulating chiral gauge theories on the lattice). A few years ago I developed computational physics material for second-year physics courses.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Scholarships every year for academic performance.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: I act as a TA for a computational physics course

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

Special Bonus Points: Taken cross-listed grad courses in HEP and GR, taking full on grad courses QFT 1 this fall and QFT 2 this spring. Also doing a full-year experimental Higgs analysis as a project course, and supervised study in string theory in the spring. My transcript is littered with A+s (haven't had an A in over 2 years), including high A+s in grad courses.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:

Applying to Where:
All for hep-th (mainly in formal aspects of field theory with interest in string theory, AdS/CFT, phenomenology and applications of QFT to condensed matter systems)

University of Toronto - Accepted for direct-entry PhD via email (2/6)
McGill - Accepted via email (2/6) - will attend due to fantastic match with supervisor
Cornell- Accepted via website (2/7) - $25,594 TA + summer stipend
Yale - surprise phone interview on (2/1), unofficial acceptance (2/11), accepted via email (2/18) - $31,250

Undergrad Institution: UC Riverside
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): n/a
GPA in Major: 3.11
Overall GPA: 3.12
Length of Degree: 5 years (transfer student)
Position in Class: Average? A little less than?
Type of Student: Domestic Female

GRE Scores (revised/old version):
Q: 152/52% (screw you ETS, I can do diff eqs)
V: 158/77%
W: 4.5/73%
P: Abysmal



Research Experience: Summer REU at UCSD doing brown dwarf stuff. Got like 85% of the way to a paper. Gave a small presentation at the end of the REU session.
11 months and ongoing with prof at UCR doing PAH analysis. Trying to get the paper on arxiv before the application deadlines so I can put it on my CV, will be first author. Also doing a poster for this at the AAS meeting in January.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: None

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Research Assistant

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: none

Special Bonus Points: Female. Plus two very strong letters of rec. from well connected people. Oh yeah, almost forgot, I can program like a boss and pick up various programming languages fairly quickly.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I have clinical depression but I was only recently able to get it diagnosed and start treatment this June (I didn't have the means to do so before). It trashed my lower div GPA and was threatening to do the same for my upper div. It didn't leave me with a whole lot of time to study for the PGRE either (had to adjust to meds, etc). Since most of my application deadlines are in January, I will have my GPA from this quarter to not only boost my GPA overall but to give as an example of my real potential. Hopefully my semi-decent (except for thermo) upper div grades and good recommendations will alleviate my PGRE score a little...........

Applying to Where:

Theory or Obs. - Cosmology, quasars

UCSD - Physics & Astronomy - Rejected
Arizona State - SESU - ???
UCSC - Astronomy - stuff didn't get there in time
Caltech - Astronomy - Rejected (lol wasn't expecting to get in anyway)
U Arizona - Physics & Astronomy - Rejected
Penn State - Astronomy - Rejected
U Virginia - Astronomy - Rejected
U Washington - Astronomy - stuff didn't get there in time
UCR - Physics & Astronomy - Rejected
Rutgers - Astronomy - Rejected

Yeah, this was the result I expected. Maybe I will try again this year or wait, save up some money, and try next year so I can also apply to some European schools.

Undergrad Institution: Northeastern state school
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): N/A
GPA in Major: 3.65
Overall GPA: 3.7
Length of Degree: 5 years (started physics year and a half in)
Position in Class: No idea/don't care
Type of Student: Domestic Male

GRE Scores (revised/old version):
Q: 167 (practice test)
V: Taking GRE 11/19
W: GRE 11/19
P: ? - November test date. Timed 2008 practice exam - 870



Research Experience:

1) One year - Developed program to simulate muon lifetime in an experimental spark chamber. Now in use in an intermediate physics lab.

2) One year - Produced original research on charged granular media. Academic award. Honors thesis. Publication as first author in progress.

3) By the time of deadlines, one year at the National Institutes of Health. Will remain there until graduate school begins. Bio-physics. One publication as first author in progress. Another publication as second author in preparation. Another publication that will be started for submission ~spring 2013 (1st author). Current work is beginning to look like an additional publication before Fall 2013. My current work is entirely my own design, with some input from PI.

4) Several posters and presentations.

Poster- Small liberal arts college.
Poster- NIH post-bac poster session.
Poster- Small conference.

Talk: Honors thesis defense.
Talk (upcoming) - Seminar series.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Graduated with honors. Magna cum laude. Honors with Great Distinction. NIH fellowship award.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: University hired Physics and Math tutor for 2 years. Private tutoring for 2 years. Supplemental instructor for a physics course for 1 year. Undergraduate physics TA for a year.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Nope.

Special Bonus Points: Strong letters of recommendation. Two are well established in the field I am applying to with hundreds of publications under their belts. Two are Harvard alum and one Princeton, if that matters.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Medical circumstances (extended hospitalization) one semester resulted in an F in a course. (should have explored campus resources to deal with the matter, which probably could have been resolved). Strong interdisciplinary marks (Physical chem, Organic chem, and biology courses)

Applying to Where:

Tentative list for bio-physics and applied physics:

Harvard (applied physics)
MIT (Medical physics program)
Johns Hopkins (Bio-physics)
UCSF (Bio-physics)
UC Berkley (Bio-physics)
UPenn (Bio-physics)
Yale (Bio-physics)
Cornell (Bio-physics)
UChicago (Bio-physics)
U Wisconsin-Madison (Bio-physics and applied physics)
Stanford (Bio-physics)
Princeton (Bio-physics)
U Maryland (Applied physics)
Oxford (NIH-Ox-Cam program)

My greatest challenge will be submitting everything in on time. Some GRE scores (subject only) will be past some deadlines. Those programs allow official score reports after the deadline, so long as everything else is in. Just hope it doesn't hurt my chances. If not this year, there's always next year, which I think I will be a much stronger applicant with all those papers in the works. Can't stand to think of being in limbo from Sept 2013-August 2014, which might happen. Significant other (4 years together) is applying to medical school, so out of interest of staying together, I may only consider schools in the same area.

Undergrad Institution: Top 20 Liberal arts college, no physics reputation
Major(s): Physics/Mathematics
Minor(s): None
GPA in Major: 4.18 (Hooray for grade inflation!)
Overall GPA: 4.20
Length of Degree: 3.5 years
Position in Class: 1/519 in full school, top of 7 in physics
Type of Student: Domestic White Male

GRE Scores:
Q: 170 (99%)
V: 165 (95%)
W: 5.5 (94%)
P: 800 (74%)

Research Experience:
1 Summer + 2 semesters in computational biophysics at my home institution
1 Summer in high energy at NIST Gaithersburg (on neutron decay)
1 Summer in experimental gravitation at Sapienza University in Rome, Italy (on VIRGO)
Senior thesis on loop quantum gravity

Biggest issue is I have no publications (not even in the et. al.), only a couple dinky conference presentations

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Goldwater scholarship, and a bunch of college prizes for having a nice GPA

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: I graded P-chem for a semester.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: A couple decent Putnam scores (28 in 2010, 10 in 2011, and though it didn't help, 30 in 2012)

Special Bonus Points: Nope

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I have never been arrested - that should count for something, right?

Applying to Where (All in gravitational physics/cosmology, with theory emphasis):

Columbia - Rejected 3/26/2013 by email to check website
Michigan - Waitlisted 3/18/2013 by email then Rejected 4/2/2013 by email
Maryland - Rejected 3/16/2013 by email to check website
UC Davis - Accepted 2/5/2013 by email. TA @ $21,600 +$5k fellowship Will Attend!
LSU - Accepted 1/25/2013 via email. TA @ $22,000 yr-1 Declined (Great group in gravity, though; it was a tough call!)
Perimeter PSI program - Rejected 4/5/2013 by email

Post-script: Ironically in hindsight, if I'd spent the summer between my junior and senior year studying for the PGREs instead of doing work on VIRGO, I could've had a chance at the top 20. But 74% just ain't going to cut it, particularly for theory, particularly with no papers, particularly from a liberal arts college. I guess I get what I deserve.

GRE Scores (revised/old version):
Q: 167 (98%)
V: 166 (94%)
W: 6.0 (99%)
P: 860 (82%)

Research Experience: Did experimental research on superconductors freshman year (I only lasted a couple months). Joined theoretical group at my university that summer, and have stayed there for the last three years. First project was on metamaterial waveguides (Goldwater honorable mention), then the following summer did the NUF program at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. Presented at the 2011 APS plasma meeting as both a poster and a talk to the beam physics group (Goldwater scholarship). Continued the project for the next year (waiting on experimental data for journal publication - but PPPL published my report locally already), then researched topological insulators abroad at Wuerzburg the next summer. Now doing thesis project on photonic topological insulators.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Goldwater, various university scholarships and research fellowships, Marshall scholarship

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: TA for two years, "Student Ambassador" (recruitment stuff)

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Rhodes finalist, Phi Beta Kappa

Special Bonus Points: 5 grad classes including QFT, good recs

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: With the math major, there are a lot of esoteric math courses on my transcript that might be pertinent to theory and theorists.

Applying to Where:

Harvard - Physics - CMT
Cambridge - Part III - Accepted, email notification - Will attend!

Hertz - Interview (January) - Did not receive

*An interesting note about the NSF, which should also apply to the other governmental fellowships - they apparently stopped letting people use these fellowships at non-US schools a couple of years ago, so if you plan on going abroad for your graduate studies, you have to find some other source of funding. Further, the way I read the rules at least, you can't even defer an NSF if you're planning to go to a non-US institution for a master's - which in my opinion is kind of absurd. (The rules state that you can only defer if you're at an institution at which the NSF is tenable. See the FAQ (http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2012/nsf12062/nsf12062.pdf), questions 10 and 52.)

In the Oct exam I wasn't prepared and attempted less than 50% . In Nov 2012, (Dang :!: ) was well prepared and hoped for 800+. Must have messed something up. I have low expectations on getting an admit this year and I am not sure how I can improve my overall application except for an improved PGRE score. Hopefully my SOP does a good job of explaining the convoluted career path to a Physics Phd. I did not want to apply to a lot of safety schools just to get an admit. I would like to get into a program I want to get into but I am getting older with each passing year :). Hoping for the best!!

Length of Degree: 4
Position in Class: upper 20%
Type of Student: Domestic white male

GRE Scores : (revised)
Q: 168 (97%)
V: 169 (99%)
W: 4.5 (73%)
P: 850 (82%)

Research Experience: No publications. One year in a solar physics group at my school. The same project employed me for for a year after I graduated, which included 6 months at Lockheed Martin's Solar and Astrophysics Lab. The work was mostly in optics (90% experiment, 10% theory).

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Full Tuition, honors program at undergrad institution. Several departmental and outside scholarships. Physics Department's "Outstanding Senior Award".

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: SPS officer for one year. See "Research Experience".

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Took a year off to do random, unrelated things (like play in a band and travel).

Applying to Where: I'm aiming at Astrophysics/Cosmology (and gravity theory, where relevant) ... not particularly easy fields to get into, especially considering my research experience is totally unrelated, and I've not taken the corresponding grad courses.

UT-Austin - Physics (accepted 2-25, $16,550 TA + 6000 1yr fellowship)
U Chicago - Astronomy and Astrophysics - Rejected
UCSB - Physics (accepted 2-7, TA post $17,655/9months)
Stanford - Physics (rejected 3-1 via email)
Tufts - Physics and Astronomy (accepted 2-25 via email, 23k TA over 9 months)
Arizona State - Physics
Pitt - Physics and Astronomy (accepted 2-6, 1yr fellowship $29,559 over 9 months)

I'm starting to think I aimed too high. I'm nervous, but hey, who isn't at this point? Good luck everyone!

Undergrad Institution: Top-50 university in the southern US; public.
Major(s): B.S. Physics.
Minor(s): Math.
GPA in Major: 4.0
Overall GPA: 3.965
Length of Degree: 3 years, typically 4.
Position in Class: Probably second in physics, very near top overall (within top 50 of 4000).
Type of Student: White, domestic male.

GRE Scores : Revised
Q: 168 (97)
V: 160 (83)
W: 4.0 (49)
P: 790 (72)

Research Experience: At own university since just before last summer. I worked in computational atmospheric physics for the summer, and have been working in condensed matter theory since August. I am third author on a paper from the atmospheric research which should be submitted for review soon. In short, far too little...

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Sigma Pi Sigma, way too many times on the President's List for only a couple of minor engineering+science college-wide scholarships.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Informal tutor, president of SPS--we just got awarded a good deal of AIP funds for a cyclotron.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

Special Bonus Points: Lots of abstract math--first two years I did linear; seminar+competition for Putnam; the two-semester undergraduate real analysis course; one-semester intro. to groups, rings, and fields. Did the physics program really fast--my only "required" course this semester is QM 2, and that's just because I had a scheduling conflict and couldn't take QM 1 a year early in autumn 2011. Grad courses--audited one-semester mechanics, currently enrolled in one-semester QFT. In a very small one-semester course on string theory, as one of two undergrads, in addition to three auditing grads (using Zwiebach's book).

Research Experience: A lot of research experience with the ATLAS experiment at CERN. I started my junior year on a physics analysis project, and once I graduated, I took a year off to do an internship at a national lab with a hardware project (still with ATLAS). I've had a lot of time to gain experience/competence working on the experiment. I've been working towards an internal note, but no papers published.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: I was given a fellowship to do my research in Geneva for a summer. That was a lot of fun.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: I tutored and helped TA a class while I was in college. Both of those were enjoyable, too.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: I presented a poster and have given a talk about my research at the national lab.

Special Bonus Points: I feel like my recommendations were strong, one from each of my research advisers and one from my lab professor.

Undergrad Institution: Ivy, consistently top 3 in major
Major(s): Engineering Physics
Minor(s): N/A
GPA in Major: 3.67
Overall GPA: 3.66
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: Above average, but not the top
Type of Student: Domestic white male

GRE Scores: (revised)
Q: 167 (96%)
V: 158 (77%)
W: 5.5 (96%)
P: 930 (90%)


Research Experience: Did an REU during summer of 2012 on fabricating and characterizing vertical silicon nanopillar schottky diodes. Poster session and presentation at the end, and conference paper (second author) resulted from it. I've also been accepted to a follow-on research program in Japan this summer at the National Institute for Materials Science, where I'll be studying transport of electrons in quantum wells, wires, and dots (which is exactly the sort of research I want to perform in grad school). The professor I'll be working with is quite well known in this field. Unfortunately, this only shows up on a few of my apps.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Lots of high school things (AP distinctions, National Merit commended, NHS, etc.) but nothing except NSCS and Dean's list for college.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Physics tutor for a year, TA for an intro physics class for a semester, tutored privately in physics a small amount.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: The classes and research I've done have pretty much branded me for the area of research I want to do, which I hope will show my interest and preparation.

Special Bonus Points: 3 grad classes directly relevant to what I want to do (two A's, one B+), and an A+ in Intro Solid State Physics, which is what I want to research in. (Taking 1 more grad class this Spring semester).

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I have worked 15+ hours/week my entire time at college, on top of a full courseload. I did poorly in math classes like multi-variable calc and especially Linear Algebra (but I got A-'s in Mathematical Physics I and II). I'm hoping since I'm applying to experimental condensed matter that these grades won't matter too much.

Applying to Where: (Research interest is in Condensed Matter Experiment, specifically nanoelectronics for all)

Non-minority domestic male here. I too am one of those people who, despite admissionprof's reassurances, is irrationally afraid of posting my profile before acceptances come in. I will update later, of course.

Expressed research interest was theory/computation in complex systems or biophysics, but also open to experiment.

GRE Scores : Nov 2012
Q: 159 (77%)
V: 161 (86%)
W: 5.0 (92%)
P: 620 (37%)


Research Experience: Astrophysics research with professor at my college during my sophomore year, no paper published. Inter-departmental (Biology/Physics) research using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) the summer after my junior year (again with professors at my college), no paper published.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Several grants and scholarships to attend my undergrad, including a scholarship granted to women in the sciences.
Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Two years as a grader, four years as a student office worker for the Physics department, two years of private tutoring experience, one year as a TA/lab assistant after I graduated

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

Special Bonus Points: female, one of my recommenders worked with the Supernova Cosmology Project (won Nobel Prize in 2011), I took a "comprehensive" track within my major (meaning that I took nearly every physics course offered at my school). I also feel like I should mention that I was able to tie-in my semester abroad (in Costa Rica) to my research interest (alternative energy) in my personal statement. I think it does a lot to make a person stand out, it's not the kind of experience that very many physics majors have and it makes you seem more human.

Undergrad Institution: Small public liberal arts school with good physics/math professors
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): Mathematics (only 1 course + capstone short of getting the double major)
GPA in Major: 3.67 (3.925 starting sophomore year)
Overall GPA: 3.494

Position in Class: Department chair said I was close to the top
Type of Student: Domestic white male

GRE Scores : (revised)
Q: 165 (92%)
V: 156 (69%)
W: 4.5 (73%)
P: 590 (30%)


Research Experience:
(all at my school)
- 1 semester gamma ray burst research
- 1 semester gravitational wave memory research
- 2 semesters studying blazar variability using the NASA Kepler telescope (presented poster at APS 2012 meeting in Atlanta, GA)
- Continued blazar variability research during Summer 2012 through college's summer research program (paper currently in preparation with me as a co-author, should be submitted by mid-late February)

Pertinent Activities or Jobs:
- Observatory technician for 1.5 years at my school's observatory
- Treasurer of Physics Club

Special Bonus Points:
- 2 of my recommendation writers graduated with PhD's at UPenn, another one was on undergraduate admission committee at UPenn
- 1 recommendation writer was professor at Georgia State

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:
- I did quite poorly my freshman year (finished with 2.9 GPA) but I had skipped intro physics/calculus courses with AP scores and jumped right into the standard sophomore year curriculum. However my first semester of sophomore year I took 4 senior-level physics courses (classical mechanics, quantum, thermo, general relativity) plus my first research project and finished with a semester GPA of 3.85. Since then I've done pretty well.

- I've taken discrete math, linear algebra, linear algebra II, complex analysis, partial diff eq., abstract algebra, mathematical modeling

Drexel - Accepted via email 2/23 with full tuition + $22.5k TA (12 months)
Georgia State - Invited for skype/phone interview 2/12 - Accepted via email 2/18 with full tuition + $20k stipend

Note about skype interview: Having already been accepted to UNM, I went into this much more relaxed and it helped a lot. It was very casual and I just spoke with 2 professors who were doing research similar to what I've done and asked me what kind of things I did for the research. In no way were they "testing my knowledge" of physics/astro at any point. They didn't even ask me specific questions about the research after I was done talking. Then I asked them a few questions about their program and they answered. Overall it took about 15-20 minutes and at the end they told me I was near the top of their list and I should receive an offer from them.

Here I go... I decided to post mine to show that it isn't hopeless if you're a member of the 700 club.

Undergrad Institution: Small school you've never heard of.
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): Chemistry
GPA in Major: 4.00
Overall GPA: 3.99
Length of Degree: 3.5 Years
Position in Class: #1
Type of Student: African American Male

GRE Scores :
Q: 164 (90%)
V: 159 (80%)
W: 3.5 (30%) (I basically just wrote a paragraph for each since no one cares)
P: 760 (67%)

Research Experience: 3 REUs: LSU, MIT, Johns Hopkins. Did research at my school for two years.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Dean's List the whole way through. Highest GPA awards for 3 years in a row. A student researcher of the year award. APS Minority Scholar. Bunch of other non-science related awards.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: SPS President 2 years, tutor for a couple years.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: I'm only 19.

Special Bonus Points: I don't think being an underrepresented minority wins you any point in this game. If it did... why are there still so few? Anyway I like to think my networking and interpersonal skills are very good, and helped me to secure some of these acceptances.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: My SOP is pretty good I think. Got letters from all the people I mentioned in it.

Applying to Where:

MIT - Physics - AMO Exp. ---- Accepted on 2/14 by email with Fellowship (3 yrs.)
UC Berkeley - Physics - AMO Exp. ---- Accepted on 2/5 by email with Fellowship (2 yrs.)
UIUC - Physics - CM Exp. ---- Accepted on 1/27 by email, Fellowship Nomination
Harvard - Physics - AMO Exp. ---- Accepted on 2/15 by email with Fellowship (2 yrs.)
Yale - Applied Physics - Quantum Info ---- Rejected on 3/4 by Website
Stanford - Applied Physics - Quantum Info ---- Rejected on 2/2 by snail mail (yuck!). Letter took 2 weeks to arrive.
Caltech - Applied Physics - Quantum Info ---- Rejected on 3/25 by email
U Mich - Applied Physics - Quantum Info ---- Accepted on 2/15 by email with Fellowship (1 yr.)

And just for fun...
MIT - EECS - Photonics ---- Rejected on 3/1 by Website

At this point (2/26), I think I've gotten all my acceptances and I am happy with what I got. The only reason I posted this is because back in November when I got my GRE scores, I felt very discouraged and considered not applying to top programs because of my score and home school. I heard all kind of things like MIT only accepted people from top 20 schools and they'll throw your app out if you get less than 80th percentile on the subject test. I decided I would go all in and give it a shot and maybe get into at least one school. This just goes to show schools care about more than just stats. Your SOP, research experience, and the impression you leave on your letter writers can carry a lot of weight.

Type of Student: Domestic white male

GRE Scores : Revised
Q: 168 (97%)
V: 164 (93%)
W: 4.5 (73%)
P: 890 (85%)

Research Experience: Summer of computational chemistry, summer of computational particle at REU.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Sigma Pi Sigma, Dean's List, School scholarship, nothing really worth noting.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: TA for 4 semesters upon graduation.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

Special Bonus Points: Will have taken 7 graduate courses upon graduation, including one in condensed matter physics.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:

Applying to Where (All CMT and occasionally AMO as secondary):

MIT - Physics Rejected
Harvard - Physics Rejected
UC Berkeley - Physics Rejected
Stanford - Physics Rejected
University of Chicago - Physics Rejected
University of Illinois - Urbana Champaign (UIUC) - Physics Rejected
UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) - Physics Rejected
UC San Diego (UCSD) - Physics Accepted Will know via e-mail soon.
University of Maryland - College Park - Physics Accepted $32k first two years
University of Wisconsin - Madison - Physics Accepted ~$22k first two years
Ohio State University - Physics Accepted $27k first two years
University of Minnesota - Twin Cities - Physics Accepted ~$23.5k first two years

I'm getting the feeling that I'll likely do a little worse than I had been hoping considering UIUC has already sent a large number of acceptances out and I haven't heard back. Also got an e-mail reject recently from Berkeley earlier than most. Ended up with only an afternoon to prepare for the Physics GRE due to a week-long sickness as well, but I don't know how much it affected me. Probably around 20-50 points.

Type of Student: Domestic

Undergrad Institution: Top 5 liberal arts (major not physics)
Grad Institution: Top 10 (major not physics)
Grad Institution: Large state school - ranked somewhere 100+ in rankings (major physics)

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Older student/Nontraditional (10+ years since graduating college). GPA around 3.6 - 3.8. GRE physics score was not so good.

Applying to Where:

RPI - accepted (18,500 TA) - declined
Accepted to 1 other school, where I'll be going

Pittsburgh (applied after deadline) - rejected 4/8 by email inquiry
Columbia - rejected 3/28 by an email to check website
Michigan State - rejected 3/25 by email inquiry
Northwestern - rejected 3/18 by email inquiry
Stony Brook - rejected 3/16 by email
Chicago - rejected 3/1 by an email to check website
Rochester - rejected 2/21 by an email to check website

To future applicants: GRE is the key!!

To nontraditional applicants - if you try hard, I think you can get accepted somewhere. But, you should apply to a range of schools and be cognizant of the fact that some schools might not want to take such older, nontraditional students, but others will welcome you. Also, in my case, I focused on getting research experience, instead of studying for the gre, and in retrospect, that might have been a mistake. Anyway, I'm happy and grateful I got accepted somewhere. Good luck to everyone!

Undergrad Institution: Big State School, ~top 50 in physics
Major(s):Physics and Applied Math
Minor(s):
GPA in Major:4.0
Overall GPA:4.0 (3.99 if you count A/A+ as 4 and A- as 3.75)
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: Top
Type of Student: Domestic white male

GRE Scores :
Q:164 (90%tile)
V:164 (93%tile)
W:4.5 (73%tile)
P:990 (95%tile)


Research Experience: a little over a year in theoretical/computational high energy astrophysics. Presented a poster at AAS meeting and have a 1st or 2nd author publication in preparation.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Math Honors Program, Phi Beta Kappa, a couple of small departmental scholarships

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: None, though i was funded for my research if that counts.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: None

Special Bonus Points: 3 math graduate classes and 2 physics graduate classes by the time I graduate. I have almost all A+'s in my physics and math classes. I'm also pretty sure that one recommender (my research advisor) tailored his letter to each school, and is also fairly well known in the high energy astrophysics community.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Another recommender is a math professor who knew me pretty well, and the third is a physics professor who I did not have much one-on-one interactions with. My first attempt at the physics GRE earned a 910, and Chicago and Cornell saw this.

Applying to Where:

On some of these I stated my research interests as very broad if they didn't have a ton of professors that I was interested in doing theoretical astrophysics. For those I also listed condensed matter and high energy theory as side interests, though I tried to connect that interest it to my previous work somehow. I decided to apply to only physics departments, even if the majority of professors that I was interested in were in astronomy (mainly Chicago... coincidence, I think not).

Caltech - Physics - High Energy Astrophysics theory, gravitational waves Accepted 2/22-----Declined
Stanford - Physics - High Energy Astrophysics theory Accepted 3/1 with 3-year fellowship 3/20-----Declined
Berkeley - Physics - High Energy Astrophysics theory Accepted 2/5 with 1-year fellowship-----Will attend!
Cornell - Physics - High Energy Astrophysics theory Accepted 2/1 with 1-year fellowship-----Declined
Chicago - Physics - High Energy Astrophysics theory Rejected 3/1
Maryland - Physics - Gravity theory, high energy astrophysics theory Accepted 2/27-----Declined

Undergrad Institution: Large State School, Respected Physics
Major(s): Engineering Physics (though not ABET accredited, so it might as well be physics with different electives)
Minor(s): Global Leadership Challenges (That'll probably hurt more than it helps...)
GPA in Major: 3.95
Overall GPA: 3.91
Length of Degree: 4 Years
Position in Class:
Type of Student: Domestic White Male

GRE Scores :
Q: 166
V: 163
W: 5.0
P: 770 (Not great by any stretch, but I would say an accurate rendering of my ability in the grand scheme of things; I have never been that 'smartest person in the room type' that seems to be so commonplace in physics)

Research Experience: 3 years (Academic & Summer) at Home Institution in Single Molecule Biophysics. Numerous independent projects. Two publications in respected - say mid-to-high 2nd tier - Journals (2nd author). Three papers in preparation (1x First; 2x Second Author), but the closest is about 2 months from submission; my PI is very meticulous.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Nominated for Outstanding EngPhys Graduate (I'll never get it, but it is nice none-the-less), Marshall Scholarship endorsed applicant from University, and some of those cliched honors associated with an okay GPA.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs:

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Developed a number of novel protocols using specialized equipment. Achieved 'super-user' status in Institution cleanroom on various instruments: authorized to answer questions and train other users. Worked in lab for 30+ hours/week during classes and 70+ during summer. I have worked very hard to achieve a somewhat unique skillset enabling future research at the interface of optics and nanomechanics to elucidate biological complexity on a molecular scale.

Special Bonus Points: Will have a total of 9 Graduate level courses completed before graduation. Mostly advanced (nonlinear/nano/quantum/fourier) optics, optoelectronic system design (Zemax), applied mathematics (markov/ complex variables), physics (many-body condensed matter) and nanoscale engineering (MEMS&NEMS fabrication). University, and Institution I work as part of, is very well known and arguably among the best in AMO physics.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Adviser is well connected in prospective field of application; completed graduate studies and postdoc (10+ years ago) with current Stanford faculty. Other letter writers are well respected in their fields - unrelated to the field I applied for - (one has published two science papers and one nature paper thus far this year, March 2013). Also I have an astonishing lack of formal training in biology for someone interested in applying to biophysics.

Applying to Where: (All PhD, expressed no interest in Masters program when given option on application)
Focus: Single Molecule Experiment for ultimate integration into Medical Systems Biology Perspective.

University of California, Berkeley - Biophysics - Mid-Feb Interview (notified Jan 17th); Accepted (02/25 by Phone), 3 Rotations funded by RA with $30,000+ support
Harvard University - Biophysics - Waitlisted (01/30 by Postal Mail); "You may attend if you acquire your own funding (e.g. NSF or NDSEG)"
University of California, Santa Barbara - Physics - Accepted, (02/10 by Webpage). TA with $18,000 support
University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign - Physics - Accepted, (02/18 by Email). Pending Financial Package
University of Washington, Seattle - Physics - Pending, so I am assuming this means waitlist or reject
Yale University - Applied Physics (Physical and Engineering Biology [IGPPEB]) - Accepted (02/15 by email). Financial Offer Pending
Cornell University - Applied Physics - Accepted (02/19 by Email). Financial Package Pending
Stanford University - Applied Physics - Accepted (02/02 by Email). 3 Rotation RA with $30,000+ financial support
University of Arizona, Tuscon - Optics - Accepted (02/01 by Email). RA with $17,000 financial support Felt bad, but I had to pass it along to someone who was more enthusiastic about UA (02/04)

Please note that I have posted this for information and encouragement for those interested in the process. I don't intend to gloat in the slightest. I actually debated holding off to a less contentious time, but I realized how helpful this source was for me in the process and thus I would be remiss if I never posted.

Looking back, I never would have anticipated having this success. I think this should motivate anyone with a dream of attending a top school to apply; you never know if you might get into a great school. A quick note on the biophysics emphasis: Admittedly biophysics is less prestigious (in the status granting sense) than other physics emphasizes. I cannot pinpoint why precisely this may be, but I often hear an audible scoff from my more traditional physicist friends when I mention biology. For this reason, I will acknowledge that there may be less competition among physics majors, therefore, the PGRE may carry less weight.

To those data gathering, I wish you all the best of fortune in your future applications. For those of you in the thick of it, I send congratulations on your acceptances and the best of luck in making the final decision.

Graduate Institution: top 5 school in Germany, top 20 in physics (worldwide) - same as above
Major(s): Theoretical Physics
GPA in Major: 1.20/1.00

Position in Class: above average

GRE Scores: new version
Q: 161 (83%)
V: 145 (24%)
W: 4.5 (73%)
P: 750 (65%)

TOEFL: 110 (speaking: 24)


Research Experience: Math bachelor thesis on the 'Ground State Properties of the Weakly Interacting Bose Gas' applying methods from Functional Analysis, Mathematical QM, PDE's, Distribution theory (6 months) -> no publication. Physics bachelor thesis in CMT (nonequilibrium many-body dynamics); continued working on the project after submitting the thesis (1 year altogether) -> PRB publication (1st author out of two) + a talk at my university. Physics master thesis in CMT on phase transitions in a specific cold atoms system: superfluidity, superconductivity, charge density wave, supersolidity: have first results on the T_c for unconventional superconductivity. Working on a project on a supersymmetric field theory extension - first results available (hoping to finish the thesis by June)

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Prestigious university award; 1st, 2nd and 3rd place in National Physics Olympics (high school level) - never went for an international competition, though; 2nd place for a presentation in a student physics conference (high school level); a couple of fellowships, a membership in a prestigious community

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: TA since my second semester as an undergrad in Mathematical Methods for Physics, Theoretical Mechanics (twice), Theoretical Electrodynamics, Quantum Mechanics 1, and a Physics Lab course for chemistry students.

Special Bonus Points: Recommendations from my three thesis advisors, math advisor fairly famous in the math phys community (though not CMT) - expect strong letters. Belong to the 2% (out of approx. 300 students) in my year to finish both degrees in 3 years. Took twice as many grad courses as required (scoring predominantly 100% in the final exams), including every course somehow related to CMT available + a few 'exotic' courses (QED, SUSY, GR).

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Currently taking part in journal clubs on 'Topological Insulators' and 'Ultracold Atoms'. Set up a professional homepage describing my research projects and put the link in the SOP. (it has a twofold purpose: a) to keep the admissions committees updated with my latest research results. b) I integrated and hid! a visitor counter which shows the places of recent visits - this way I also know which university is interested in my app)

Applying to Where: All CMT: mainly phase transitions, many-body dynamics, and topological insulators

Indiana University: - accepted 06/02 via email (had checked my homepage)
Boston University: - accepted 28/01 via email (had checked my homepage)
Rice: - accepted 11/03 via email (had checked my homepage)
Georgia Tech: - accepted 13/03, email enquiry (didn't check my homepage)
Penn State - rejected 28/02, email to check web (didn't check my homepage)
UMD: - rejected 08/03, email enquiry (checked my homepage after the rejection :D!)

UIUC: - rejected 23/03, via email (didn't check my homepage)
Yale: - rejected 14/02, email to check web (had checked my homepage)
Cornell: - accepted 14/02 (after a language interview), email to check web (had checked my homepage)
UC Berkeley: - rejected 02/03, email enquiry (didn't check my homepage)
UCSB: - rejected 22/03, email to check web (didn't check my homepage)
UCSD: - rejected 22/03, via email (didn't check my homepage)

My advice for future applicants:
1. before you apply to a given school, get in touch with them and ask them how many PhD positions roughly they have for the current year in your field of interest. If some schools don't give you an exact answer to this question, email directly the chair of the admissions committee, or any other prof till you figure this out. Even schools with a sound tradition in a certain field may have only 1-2 slots to offer - in which case the app fee is not worth paying.
2. international students - try to minimize the number of public schools you apply to (especially in CA!, but not exclusively) - they can be short of funding. Find some statistics (e.g. enquire from the schools themselves) about the last couple of years regarding the number of international students admitted to the public schools you want to apply to.

Undergrad Institution: Large state school in the South; About ~50 in physics ranking
Major(s): Physics/Mathematics
GPA in Major: 3.92
Overall GPA: 3.84
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: Top in physics
Type of Student: domestic white male

GRE Scores : (Revised)
Q: 170
V: 161
W: 4.5
P: 820



Research Experience: I worked with a nuclear theory group with a very reputable physicist for about 2 years. I got two coauthored publications out of this (one was in Nature!).

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Phi Beta Kappa, Sigma Pi Sigma, Pi Mu Epsilon, 1st in a math contest at my university

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Tutored/TA'd for about 2 years

Special Bonus Points: Nothing notable.. I probably should have taken some graduate classes.

Applying to Where: I applied for either string theory, particle theory, or nuclear theory for everywhere. (Looking at my results, that was probably a horrible idea..)

Berkeley - Rejected
Caltech - Rejected
Harvard - Rejected
Stanford - Rejected
Washington at Seattle - Rejected
Stony Brook - Rejected
Duke - Waitlisted
Ohio State - Accepted! $27k/year fellowship
Columbia - Rejected
UT Austin - pending (I'm really surprised I haven't heard back from UT Austin yet, since it seems almost all other domestic students heard something in February. However, in my SOP I talked about how I want to work with Dr. Weinberg, so I'd say it's a long shot.)


I was quite surprised by the number of rejections I received. I guess for theory schools want you to have a higher PGRE.

PGRE is a very important aspect of course and I didnt know how to study for it properly. I think I am pretty fortunate to get acceptances from schools even though I dont really know what I want to do other than experimental work. Also I really screwed myself over by taking a heavy load for a quarter after transferring.

For posterity, and all future applicants discouraged by their relatively low gpa

Undergrad Institution: UCSB
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s):
GPA in Major: Not great, something like a 3.3, got a lot of B's some A-'s and one painful C+ in general relativity
Overall GPA: 3.5 at UCSB, 3.8 at community college
Type of Student: (Domestic white

GRE Scores : (revised or old version?)
Q: 75%
V: 91%
W: 44%
P: 640 the first time in 2011, retook in 2012 got a 810, hell yea! I studied my butt off after work every day, flash cards are key

Research Experience: Summer internship at LANL no publication, worked with new prof at ucsb 1 publication, got lucky but am like 4th author so...

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: my prof is kind, she gave me some kind of outstanding effort award

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: so after graduating and getting in nowhere i went to work in industry for a small company, doing optics and programming. small companies are the best because they give you lots of responsibility. i had a phd recommending me highly, very good letter of rec.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: none

Special Bonus Points: nothing

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: nope

Applying to Where:

I applied to all condensed matter experiment

UCSD - admitted march 15ish - will attend - 17.6k / 9 months
UCI - admitted jan 30th base TA + 5k bonus- declined
UC Davis - admitted with base TA 23k ish - declined


USC - never even responded after taking my money, the pompous jerk-offs, not that I would have went anyway to their #50 school. im a bit miffed - if i pay $80 the LEAST you can do is shoot off an automatic reject like the others. i found this quite unprofessional.

Caltech applied physics, Boulder, Washington, UCLA all said no

Undergrad Institution: Top 15 school in the UK
Major(s): Physics with Astrophysics
Minor(s):-
GPA in Major: First Class, something like a 3.8
Overall GPA: First Class, something like a 3.8
Position in Class: 3rd
Type of Student: International

GRE Scores : (revised)
Q: 157 71%
V: 150 44%
W: 4.5 73%
P: 700 (Nov 2012)
Research Experience:
12 month internship at RAL, Oxfordshire. No publication, but carried out instrument design which got adopted. Supervisor quite senior and famous in the field.
2 months at University of Queensland: Dark Matter research. Again supervisor involved with leading projects. (Not my referee though)
Undergraduate thesis research in Condensed Matter Physics: Conference award but no publication.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Performance Scholarship every year from uni, The conference award above. The RAL internship was quite competitive to get - only 15 or so people get it every year.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Two very good LORs, the third I later found was a little too general for my liking but still positive.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Some public outreach - national exhibition + newspaper, awards at national physics competitions for high school students.

Special Bonus Points: nothing

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Poor PGRE + I am international!

Applying to Where:


I applied to Physics/Astro programs:

PhD programs:
Johns Hopkins - rejected - had to email to get the bad news. (April)
Ohio State - rejected - had to email to get the bad news. (April)
UPenn - rejected - website rejection (March 21)

Masters Programs:
UBC - rejected - website rejection - April 6
ETH Zurich - Accepted - but didn't get the Scholarship - March
Leiden - Accepted - with 75% Tuition waiver

Overall I am quite dissapointed with the results. I chose the schools that would normally take on students with poorer PGREs but I guess being an international student anything below a 900 is risky business. I thought I had decent research experience but it's the 0 publications that must have kept me away. Perhaps I should have applied to a few more safety schools. The masters programs I applied to all offer good scholarships but I failed there too. Still thinking if I can afford Leiden - its a great place though.

Position in Class: near top
Type of Student: white female, disability.

GRE Scores :
Q: 157
V: 152
W: 5? (don't remember)
P:550 - I'm posting this for all those who think a bad PGRE score is end of the world

Undergrad Institution: Large top 50 physics state school
Major(s): Physics, Math
Minor(s):
GPA in Major: ~4.0
Overall GPA: 3.89
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: Probably second
Type of Student: Domestic white male

GRE Scores : Revised
Q: 165
V: 161
W: 4.0
P: 790


Research Experience: Two undergrad research projects in totally different areas of HET which included a senior thesis, one REU (no publication) in nuclear theory at outside school which yielded a very strong letter of rec

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Incoming to college lots of scholarships (why I chose my undergrad institution), a few departmental/university awards but no major national ones

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Tutored and was involved in SPS, but didn't write much about this in my SOP (stupid me probably), so I don't think it's relevant as it was just a line or two on my CV.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

Special Bonus Points: Some grad coursework.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I applied to some schools where in my SOP I talked about wanting to work in one specific area (that I have a good amount of previous work in, two of my letter writers are very well known in this area). At the time I rationalized it could help in schools I might not have a chance at getting into and I thought I was sure I wanted to work in it. Now... I am not nearly as sure about this. I actually chose a program that doesn't have a faculty member working in this exact field, but I am happier anyways. I would just warn anyone from being overly sure of wanting to do one specific thing. This would have definitely changed some of the schools I applied to.

Applying to Where:
Applied for nuclear and high energy theory universally (where applicable)

The Bad
MIT - Physics - Rejected (appealed to work with a junior faculty member I knew (and is also in the aforementioned research area) knowing my chances were a long shot)
Yale - Physics - Rejected
UChicago - Physics - Rejected
Columbia - Physics - Rejected
University of Washington- Seattle - Physics - Rejected

The Good
University of Wisconsin-Madison - Physics -Accepted w/ Fellowship, about $21k/yr
Ohio State University - Physics -Accepted w/ Fowler and University Fellowships, would be about $30k/yr
College of William and Mary - Physics -Accepted
Boston University - Physics -Accepted
University of Arizona - Physics -Accepted w/ ~$15k/yr stipend
SUNY Stony Brook - Physics -Accepted, $20k +~5k for summer- Will Attend

Fellowships:
JLab Distinguished Theory Student Fellowship - Full funding to William & Mary, full membership to JLab theory group, plus extra money and funds for new computer -Awarded- Declined :?

For me, I had to choose a school that is strong in the two main areas I am interested in, nuclear theory and high energy theory. While I had a really great opportunity at JLab, I just didn't know that was exactly what I wanted to do and thought Stony Brook offered the most, with both their in house faculty and people at Brookhaven. Wisconsin was a close second, I loved my visit to Madison and could see myself happy there. However, it seemed their department was having issues as two of their top phenomenologists and one top nuclear person had left recently. Stony Brook seemed to be growing in the areas I was interested in rather than shrinking, and was my obvious choice even if the area isn't as great as Madison.

Special Bonus Points: Connections to UCLA and Berkeley through research. I think two letters of rec should be very positive, and I have two others that should be good (one from each research adviser).

Applying to Where:
I'm not entirely sure what I want to do - either AMO or plasma experiment, but I'm leaning towards plasma. I've worked on research projects involving both, so I can sell myself as either at the moment.
MIT - Physics - Plasma experimental - Accepted 2/17 by mail, ABB-MIT fellowship (21k/9mo for the first year). [Will attend]
Princeton - Plasma Physics - Plasma experimental - Interviews 1/30, 2/9. Accepted 2/24 by e-mail (22k/9mo fellowship + 8k summer RA). [declined]

Major(s): Physics and Mathematics
Minor(s): None
GPA in Major: Physics: 3.55, Math: 3.36
Overall GPA: 3.39
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: Top fifth
Type of Student: Domestic white male

GRE Scores:
Q: 740
V: 560
W: 5
P: Really, really bad...

Research Experience: Independent projects since sophomore year. Physics REU at SUNY Stony Brook in summer of 2008 (theoretical solid state -- heat conduction in molecular dynamics). Senior research in thin film hydrogen absorption (abstract submitted by advisor for presentation at 2009 APS March Meeting -- I am listed as the second author).

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Sigma Pi Sigma, Pi Mu Epsilon, 2008 Mary Reklis Award for Physics (college honor).

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Graded algebra based intro physics homework sophomore year. Teaching assistant for calculus based intro physics recitation sessions since sophomore year. Last year and this year I am tutoring/TAing for both algebra based and calculus based intro courses. Also work as a one-on-one tutor, as well as an "on-call" type tutor for math and physics at a help center on campus (since junior year). Have also had other jobs including telemarketing for university donations and at a computer tech support center.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Nothing really that I haven't already included.

Special Bonus Points: Probably only that my advisor for senior research has been very active with publications/collaborations lately. Also applying to a lot of the universities those who are writing recommendation letters attended. One of the professors writing me a letter of recommendation just published a textbook in linear algebra that is getting a good reception. It is already being adopted at quite a few colleges in the US.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: My general chemistry grades might not be so good, considering I want to get into experimental condensed matter.

Applying to Where:

SUNY Stony Brook - Physics - Condensed Matter Experiment
University of Minnesota - Physics - Condensed Matter Experiment Rejected 02/18/2009 by e-mail
Ohio State University - Physics - Condensed Matter Experiment
Georgia Tech - Physics - Condensed Matter Experiment Rejected 03/03/2009 by e-mail
University of Rochester - Physics - Condensed Matter Experiment Rejected 03/06/2009 by e-mail
Northern Illinois University - Physics - Condensed Matter Experiment Accepted 02/26/2009 with ~$15k/10 months TA.

I guess the GRE really is important.

UWash - Physics- CME Rejected 4/7 by email
UOregon - Physics - CME waitlisted 3/12 then rejected 4/15
Colorado School of Mines - Physics- CME waitlisted
UDelaware - Physics- CME Accepted!!! 1/9 by email with $30k IGERT PV fellowship

Things didn't work out quite as hoped, with only one acceptance and a lot of money wasted on rejections. I think I aimed too high, got bad GRE scores (I was expecting at least 800) and had a tough year. For future applicants I recommend taking the GRE early so you will have time to retake, or at least some indication of where you can get in. Also be careful deciding on safety schools, I thought mines, oregon and del would all be safe and I would probably get into UCSC. Turns out I only got into del, which has good research in what I want to do (PV) but weak in overall physics. Good luck to all future applicants!

I'm in a slightly unusual situation, so I don't know how much help it'll be overall...

Undergrad Institution: State engineering school
Major(s): Applied Physics
Minor(s): Applied Math
GPA in Major: 3.85ish
Overall GPA: 3.79
Length of Degree: 4.5 years
Position in Class: Near if not at the top for physics students, no clue rest of university
Type of Student: American as apple pie female

GRE Scores:
Q: 740
V: 570
W: 4.5
P: reaaaaaaaally bad :(



Research Experience: Summer REU 2007, independent study/minor lab work this past summer that wasn't quite as productive as I'd have hoped...

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Honors college, Outstanding UG Student Award.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: SPS VP, tutored physics and pre-calc, Physics I homework TA last semester. Also help run weekly journal/physics topic discussion group.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Very active within the department (open houses, accepted student days, etc) and was on committee for programs for first year women students the past year.

Special Bonus Points: I hate to say it, but being female is probably all I got going :oops: I also already got to visit the lab I am interested in working with, but I don't think they have any say in admissions....

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Well I obviously didn't put this on my application but I am locked to the NJ/NYC area due to my fiance's job. In addition, since I graduate this month I was trying for a spring admission so depending on how that goes I'll either update with ACCEPTED! or some other schools for my "round two" applications - I should find out within a few weeks!

Applying to Where:

Rutgers - Physics - HEP Experimental (spring 2009) ACCEPTED 1/9 with TA position

Undergrad Institution: Big State School
Major(s): Philosophy
GPA in Major: 2.5
Overall GPA: 3.2 (I thought philosophy loved me :()
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: not sure, and not good :) ( bottom 25% )
Type of Student: white dude

Master's Institution: Bigger Less Competitive State School
Major(s): Physics (theoretical)
GPA in Major: 4.0
Overall GPA: 4.0
Length of Degree: 5 years (lots of ups and downs - no easy or short path for me)
Position in Class: ?
Type of Student: the same as the previous institution

GRE Scores:
Q: 780(90%)
V: 660(94%)
W: 5(77%)
P: 640(42%) Awful - I have terrible test taking anxiety like a number
of dudes here - I should probably get my self diagnosed so I can get double
time, although that just sounds wrong. It's been with me since I can remember.
Hopefully it won't cause me to wait another year.

Research Experience:
I did do a masters thesis and its contents were talked about on a poster :).

Pertinent Activities or Jobs:
Tutor for 8+ years in math and physics. TA for more than 2 years.

Special Bonus Points:
Not to my knowledge. I've finished an MS at a not so rigorous institution as
opposed to others who have finished a BS (or even an MS) from a competitive
institution - not saying that what I did was easy, but most likely comparable
to these undergraduate classes and no higher.

Like many I have a lot of computing skills, but if one is serious about physics
then it appears highly probable that one acquires these skills. So I am not too
certain how different I am to others in this area.

Applying to Where:
UC SC Physics - Physics (& Astronomy) - HEP - rejected - email - 3/5/09
UC D Physics - Physics (& Astronomy) - HEP - rejected - web 4/12/09

U Minnesota - Physics (& Astronomy) - HEP - rejected - email - 2/18/09
UMass Amherst - Physics (& Astronomy) - HEP - waitlisted -> rejected

Position in Class: 1st, 2nd or 3rd in class
Type of Student: domestic female

GRE Scores:

Q: 670
V: 590
W: 5
P: 530 :oops:

Research Experience:

Lots of experience starting as a sophomore. Did some internships that were quite good, and spent last year and half working on general relativity/mathematical physics project.

Numerous presentations including national conferences, Posters on Capitol Hill, APS meetings, student conferences. Will be taking current research to gravity meeting and SPS zone meeting in the spring to give a talk.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions:

New exciting award! I'm the College of Science Undergrad. Researcher of the Year for 2008!!! :D
Rhodes Scholar Finalist
Goldwater Honorable Mention
APS award for best presentation at meeting
Undergraduate Research Fellowship from my university
Some smaller scholarships and 4 year academic scholarship from my institution as well. Hopefully will get NSF fellowship!?

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Was secretary of SPS chapter for a year, member of Sigma Pi Sigma, member of reputable undergrad. research team that launches stuff into space via NASA (really well-known in some circles), designed & led experiment for NASA's Vomit Comet program, graded ODEs and introductory modern physics for 2 semesters. Am now teaching an introductory physics lab.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Two graduate math classes (multilinear algebra and differential geometry) and graduate physics class ... there's lots else, but none going in the applications (not physics related)

Special Bonus Points: No connections, no famous people. But I'm a female, maybe that will help? And my letters will be quite good, because all my recommenders know me very well and are based on good research.

If only I could explain that despite my PGRE and QGRE, I actually spend my free time reading Misner, Thorne and Wheeler's "Gravitation", manipulating solutions to the Einstein equations, and computing Killing vector fields and isometry groups. I can't remember polygons, but I can do tensors!! :!: WTF??

Undergrad Institution: Medium-sized state school. Not a particularly well-known school, but in my experience those who do know of our program have a favorable impression.
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): Math
GPA in Major: 3.87 (Increased to 3.89 after Fall 2008, updated transcript sent)
Overall GPA: 3.72 (Increased to 3.75 after Fall 2008, updated transcript sent)
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: Unknown, but probably top 15% or above
Type of Student: Domestic white male

GRE Scores:
Q: 730 (79%)
V: 630 (90%)
W: 4.5 (58%)
P: 750 (66%)

Research Experience:
A year of research at my own school plus 2 REUs at different schools (all on topics which could be considered experimental condensed matter). Combined research resulted in two conference presentations, one submitted paper for publication, and two papers ‘in preparation’, but nothing published yet.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Scholarship, Dean’s List, and something which could be loosely classified as an external award for ‘science tutoring’.

Special Bonus Points: Letters of recommendation from each of my three research advisors. Although I do not know what they wrote, all three letters should be good, and (at least in theory) they could even be very good to excellent. At one of the school I am applying to I have prior experience conducting research with the professors who heads the graduate admissions committee and also wrote one of my letters of recommendation.

Applying to Where:

In all cases, I am applying to the Physics department for Experimental Condensed Matter

Undergrad Institution: Technical University, Top 20 depending who you ask
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): History
GPA in Major: 3.1 (see "additional info")
Overall GPA: 3.21
Length of Degree: 4.5 years (due to study abroad)
Position in Class: Finishing towards the top
Type of Student: domestic female

GRE Scores:
Q: 720
V: 550
W: 5.0
P: 500 (12%) :?

Research Experience: Been working for the high-energy astrophysics group on my campus for 2.5 years on a gamma ray detector and the "big cosmic ray collaboration" as metric put it (hi!), completed senior thesis on designing/building a Cherenkov radiation detector for said group, REU this past summer working on a radio telescope array

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: national award in science writing, science journalist of the month for the publication I've worked for, "Service Award" from my physics department for all the stuff I've done there

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: TA for intro physics course, SPS President, telescope operator for public observing nights... I'm also a science writer- "geek" column in uni newspaper, have published nationally and attended scientific conferences for that, have worked 2 years as a science journalist for an undergrad research journal.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: have hosted departmental colloquia and lots of help with department outreach

Special Bonus Points: One grad class (classical mechanics), will have great letters, including one from a very famous astronomer

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I realize the GPA is on the low side if you just look at the number- basically I wasn't doing so hot my first few years, but pulled things together and have gotten straight As for ~2 years now. I'm banking a lot on a grad committee not worrying too much about the "C" in introductory E&M if I got an "A" in the advanced version, stuff like that. Not happy with the PGRE obviously, but recommenders will be addressing it.

Also, um, I'm spending my next six months doing a trip around the world. My application wasn't eclectic enough.

Applying to Where:

Boston University - Astronomy - Experiment rejected
University of Massachusetts - Astronomy - Experiment rejected
Yale - Astronomy - Experiment rejected
Columbia - Astronomy - Experiment never heard back
Rutgers - Physics - Experimental Astrophys rejected
Johns Hopkins - Physics - Experimental Astrophys never heard back
University of Maryland - Astronomy - Experiment never heard back
Case Western Reserve University - Physics - Experimental Astrophys accepted, $22k TAship
University of Chicago - Astronomy/Physics - Experiment rejected
University of California- Berkeley - Astronomy - Experiment rejected
University of California- Santa Cruz - Astronomy/Physics - Experiment rejected

Proof that all you need is one! :wink: Also not sure why three schools never answered me despite emails, I didn't find it particularly kind of them.

Undergrad Institution: Private university, good reputation in physics.
Major(s): Astrophysics
GPA in Major: 3.50
Overall GPA: 3.52 (I don't see how you guys have higher GPAs in your majors! All of the other non-physics/astronomy classes I have taken are cake compared to major courses.)
Length of Degree: 4 year.
Position in Class: I have no clue. It's difficult to rank because a B in physics is a good grade here, whereas lower than an A in English is unacceptable. I'm top amongst physics-peers.
Type of Student: (Domestic/International, male/female, minority?) Female, white... magical... j/k

GRE Scores: (MEH!)
Q: 730, 79%
V: 600 85%
W: 4.5 58%
P: 670 49%

I make no excuses, I just didn't study.

Research Experience: I have worked with multiple professors at my university, and I am currently working on unprecedented cutting edge research with a brand new instrument, which will probably publish... but not in time for applications. I also had an REU, and I will present this work at the upcoming AAS meeting.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: I don't know of any awards at my school, and I haven't applied for external ones.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: I graded for classes?

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: I gave a guest lecture to a high school astronomy class and it was super fun!

Special Bonus Points: I do have excellent letters of recommendation, written by prominent scientists in their fields.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: My GRE scores do kind of suck. My GPA also might appear to suck, but it's quite respectable coming from my institution.

Applying to Where:

University of Arizona - Astronomy -- Rejected by email 2/17
Ohio State - Astronomy -- Rejected by website 2/25, still confused about this one :? .
UMass - Astronomy -- Accepted by Phone 2/17
UT Austin - Astronomy -- Accepted by Email 1/21

Length of Degree: 4 Years as an undergrad
Position in Class: Never paid attention
Type of Student: Domestic Male, Out of School

GRE Scores:
Q: 720 (76%); 640 (58%)
V: 670 (95%); 620 (89%)
W: 4.5 (58%); 4.0 (37%)

Research Experience: None. I Never considered physics too seriously until I left school... Spent a lot of time reading the "Feynman Lectures on Physics" and the Encyclopedia Britannica to prepare for the Physics GRE after school.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Nothing

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Burned cement aggregates in a furnace for money

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Gave a seminar on the fundamental theorem of differential equations on complete normed linear spaces (Banach spaces) to obtain undergrad math degree

Special Bonus Points: I may have some enthusiastic recommendations

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Mixed record with some A's in advanced mathematics and physics courses. Focused (if you could call it that) on mathematics as an undergrad and managed a 540 on the GRE math subject test. Took some time off after taking a few graduate courses in mathematics and eventually got the itch for physics.

Applying to Where:

Stanford - Applied Physics - Condensed matter, Nanoscale Rejected by snail mail post marked 02/23/09, signed by admissions chair for professional touch
U of Illinois, Urbana - Physics - Condensed matter Rejected by email on 03/25/09

NDSEG Fellowship - Physics Rejected by email on 03/31/09
______________________________________________

Notes: Given my below average GPA and lack of research experience, I would say I was lucky to get in anywhere. As a side note, I took several graduate courses in math at NIU. My graduate advisor at the time was willing to write me a recommendation for my second attempt at graduate school, which probably helped me out immensely in being offered a spot at NIU.
