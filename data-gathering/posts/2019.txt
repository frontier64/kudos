My thoughts as of 2/14/19:

This has been a very wild ride. I am so so shock, thankful, surprised that I was accepted anywhere, let alone that I have a choice between where I'm going! Application season was tough, but waiting for responses was way tougher! Concentrating on my classes while obsessively checking this forum and the Grad Cafe was not great. If I could do it differently, here are some things I'd do:

1. Apply for NSF/any grant you can get your hands on!
2. Do NOT check Physics GRE or The Grad Cafe once you submit your applications (or at least, limit yourself!). Just let the responses roll in as they come. Don't compare yourself to others on this website. You will never know why some people got in while you didn't!

Things I think I did right:
1. Attend the AAS: I met so many people, reps, students, and professors from the schools to which I applied. I had a great time practicing my poster presenting skills and meeting people with whom I could work with next year! I would suggest encouraging your institution to fund your trip up, as I believe it could have earned me two of the three acceptances I got!

Advice to Freshmen/Sophomore/Junior international students in the United States: Be good at English. GRE and TOEFL/IELTS scores matter. It also helps when you write the statements and when you get interviewed. Find any kinds of research experiences. It is far more difficult to get it done as an international student. So try to find it as soon as possible. Professors in the United States are actually pretty nice and would not yell at you (Most of them). Join clubs. Make friends. Find helps from the mental health centers. You would find much more about yourself.

An afterthought:
I have no clue till now what was wrong with my application. Probably just the fact that I applied for HET, but upon further consideration, I don't believe I would have wanted to apply for cosmo despite having a profile tailored for it. Sometimes, all you can do is accept what comes your way, and at those times you may feel like you're getting less than what you deserve. Hope you get some help from my profile and understand everything I did wrong, including my SoP. A copy of the SoP I sent to Maryland can be found here https://1drv.ms/b/s!AgvqaOhYtUSagYUYI-KPh2PL5FVbxA.

After going through the profile of someone else from India who has been accepted into HET at TAMU at this very forum, I have realized that I was perhaps rejected from everywhere on account of either bad recommendations, bad SoP, or a lack of research in HET. The first is highly unlikely as my recommenders could not believe it when I told them about the rejection from Columbia. My SoP is here for you to see, so you can avoid the mistakes that I made, and I cannot cure the lack of research in HET for now, except for the fact that I am currently engaged in it.

I really don't know what I am going to do now.
Accepts defeat.

GRE Scores :
Q: 165 (88%)
V: 159 (83%)
W: 4.0 (59%)
P: 690 (47%) (serious ongoing family issues prevented me from studying, I mentioned in SOP)

Special Bonus Points:
- Took 2 grad courses.
- 3.80 GPA in past 3 semesters at time of application.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:
- Got second highest midterm grade in recent grad mechanics exam, impressed prof and he offered to write me a "strong letter".

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:
- One of my recommender's was over a month late sending letters.

Applying to Where:

Ph.D. All HEP-th
Stony Brook - Physics - HEP-th (1/28: ACCEPTED for Ph.D via email with $23k/9 month TA and potential Fellowship)
UCLA - Physics - HEP-th (3/26: REJECTED for Ph.D via email to check website)
UCSB - Physics - HEP-th (2/26: REJECTED for Ph.D via email to check website)
USC - Physics - HEP-th (2/22: REJECTED for Ph.D via email)
UW Madison - Physics - HEP-th (1/30: REJECTED for Ph.D via website) *One of my profs hadn't even sent my letter yet*

Master's
NYU - Physics - (3/28: ACCEPTED for M.S. via email to check website with full tuition scholarship)
Perimeter - (4/9: REJECTED for PSI after inquiry via email)
Rutger's - Physics - (4/13: REJECTED for M.S. via email and website)
UC Davis - Physics - (3/5: REJECTED for M.S. via email) *Found out they only accept ~2 M.S. students per year*
UChicago - Physical Science Division - (4/2: REJECTED for MS-PSD via email to check website)

Post-Baccalaureate
Columbia
Princeton - Physics - (3/26: REJECTED for Bridge Program via email)

I thought applying for Master's programs would be a way to more easily get into schools, and then apply to better PhD programs... instead it seems most schools consider their Master's applicants very low priority and don't touch the Master's pile until after hearing back from accepted PhD applicants. Stony Brook for example offers Master's to many rejected PhD applicants. I actually applied to Stony Brook for a Master's and they emailed me asking if I would like to be considered for the PhD, I told them I would provided they'd still consider me for the Master's, and 2 days later they accepted me for PhD. Lesson: Just apply for PhD's.

researches: all cosmology but in different sub-fields.
in my uni:
an aggregate of 1.5 years in my university following an extremely renowned professor in two different projects (one observational and one computational, both statistical properties/optical features of galaxies, but almost unrelated) -> one first author in prep
with 1 semester in middle following another professor for something completely different as a continuation of a previous summer project (computational, alternative cosmologies)
oo my uni:
first summer in computational cosmology (alternative cosmologies) -> one second author (still...) in prep
second summer in observational cosmology (neutrinos) -> one first author ready to submit

Undergrad Institution: Caltech
Major(s): Physics
GPA in Major: 3.88
Overall GPA: 3.86
Length of Degree: 5 years (first 3 years as math major)
Position in Class: No ranking. I think I was probably in the top tier, not the best of course.
Type of Student: DWM

GRE Scores (revised):
Q: 170
V: 170
W: 6
P: 990

Research Experience: 10 months full time (approx. 4 REUs worth) at a DOE national lab doing computational soft-matter work, after graduation. Minor author on a submitted crossover vivo/vitro/silico publication, not yet published. I've done other research projects here but they're all still pretty far away from a publication horizon.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: 2 semester classes short of a math major. Took 3 quarters of grad QFT, a few misc. grad applied math classes (and some pure math classes that could be graduate level at most schools), grad classes in celestial mechanics and statistical physics. Our year-long QM and Class Mech sequences are "grad classes," since grad students are required to take them (and I guess the textbooks are at the graduate level too), and I got some A+s. Lots of (non-software-dev) CS experience in school and at my job.

Special Bonus Points: All of my letter recommenders are very enthusiastic about me. One of them is very famous, although he isn't quite a physicist - I sort of did research with him, but it was brief (a single problem) and informal.

Possible flaws: A minus is that two of them both come from my sole research job; I don't know how bad this will look, but the alternative is a recommendation from one of several professors who don't remember me at all. My SoPs were written to my standards, but may not have made a whole of sense given my background. I didn't do any research at Caltech (for various dumb reasons; tbf I was only eligible for our summer fellowship once as a physics major), and I took an extra year to graduate due a change of major. I took my time getting a job after school to recover from undergrad, though in retrospect I don't think I would be ready for grad school had I not done so.

Applying to Where:

I decided to apply pretty late in the season, and I decided to ignore safety schools for the most part since my interests are very non-specific and I was originally going to apply next year anyway. I am most interested in complex systems and emergent phenomena, whether they be theoretical or applied, quantum or classical, and in particular I also really like earth systems and astro.

I picked fields on a per-school basis, and tried to describe what I put down on the application with the usual categories.

Physics schools:

MIT - Physics (Plasma/LIGO/CM) - [Short Skype "chat" 1/8 with Kavli professors] - Feb. 12 - ACCEPTED (e-mail, $3263/mo fellowship which appears to be standard) - WILL ATTEND
Cornell - Physics (Relativity/CMT) - Feb. 7 - ACCEPTED (RA/TA and $31.5k 9 month fellowship)
Harvard SEAS - Applied Physics (Bio/Matsci/fluids) - [Interview 1/21] - Feb. 6 - ACCEPTED (e-mail with letter, standard package)
Harvard GSAS - Physics (Bio/CMT/astro) - Feb. 25 - REJECTED
Princeton - Astrophysics (Planets/plasma) - Feb. 6 - REJECTED
Stanford - Physics (Bio/CME/Applied) - Feb. 20 - REJECTED (I was dumb; should have gone for applied :( )
Berkeley - Physics (Astro/CM/Bio) - Feb. 13 - ACCEPTED (e-mail)
UCSB - Physics (CMT/CME) - Feb. 5 - ACCEPTED (e-mail from adcom, $32k+ RA/TA)
CU Boulder - Physics (AMO/Quantum/LASP) - Jan. 25 - ACCEPTED (e-mail to check website, standard RA/TA, $3k bonus and extra $7k chair's fellowship)

Feb. 20: Technically Harvard hasn't gotten back to me yet, but I didn't get in, so my physics results are out. I went 6/9 with a pretty poor research record and fabulous everything else. However, it's pretty clear that the three schools that rejected me were (a) extremely selective this year and (b) not great fits, with the exception of Harvard. Perhaps Harvard and Stanford in particular look for more experienced applicants, or at least they did this year. And I've thought since January that I applied to the wrong departments at Princeton and Stanford. Regardless, I am regret-free, and glad I didn't wait another year to apply.

Here's a tip for future students: the top programs don't seem to care what you do once you get in. It's not worth your while to game their numbers (i.e. apply for something you're not interested in); they will probably see through it anyway. Just don't worry about it, if you're indecisive. I think there is a hurdle between theory and experiment, but even that should be surmountable if you have the guts for theory, the willpower to do it, and some assertiveness.

Earth sciences:

Caltech - Planetary Science - Feb. 22 - REJECTED - (prof in the department said having gone here for UG was the primary reason)
UWash - Atmospheric Science - [Three skypes starting 1/23] - Jan. 28 - ACCEPTED - (via e-mail, first year RA)
Columbia EESC - Mar. 19 - WITHDREW
MIT EAPS - [Discussion with professor 2/21] - Mar. 21 - WAITLISTED - Mar. 30 - ACCEPTED (unofficial e-mail - funding eventually came through)

Major(s): Physics
Double Major(s): Philosophy
GPA in Major: 3.41
Overall GPA: 3.33
Length of Degree: 4.5
Position in Class: don't know
Type of Student: Domestic Female

GRE Scores :
Q: 163
V: 158
W: 3.5
P: Oct, 620 (32%); Sep, 560; Apr, 570 perfectly shows that I'm not good at exam



Research Experience: three years CMT research with the same advisor, focusing on the computational condensed matter. Have one first-order publication just submitted. (The manuscript was accepted by the journal and ready for publishing. That's the only good news this year.)

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Honor Degree in physics

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: one year lab TA for introduction physics

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

Special Bonus Points: one hardcore recommendation letter. Female?? (don't think its a bonus)

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Memberships in physics and math honor societies.

Applying to Where:

Cornell - Physics - CMT - (Feb.19: Rejected via email)
Colombia - Applied Physics - CME - (Surprisingly not hearing any works back, thought this one would be the first to reject me)
Stony Brook - Physics - CMT - (Apr.9: Rejected via email)
Pittsburgh University - Physics - CMT- (Waitlist: Emile to check status)
Rutgers University - Physics - CMT - (Apr.16: Rejected via email)
Penn State - Physics - CMT - (Mar.19: Rejected via email)
Temple University - Physics - CMT
Rensselaer polytechnic institute Physics - CMT
New Jersey Inst. of Tech. - Materials Science (Mar. 22: Accepted via email with 12k/semester)

I have to say, I feel pessimistic for my applications due to the poor scores. But I choose physics just because I love research, so I won't give up until the end. And I say to myself, again and again, top20 doesn't decide everything in the future, I can live well and enjoy my work everywhere. For everyone who loves this field and dream to do research, don't give up!!


Update Apr.9th: The results are reasonable, but still feel disappointed more or less. However, I think it's a tough year for physics PhD application since I saw most results in red through the forum. My advisor said that it has been harder and harder to get a physics faculty position these years. But its also been harder and harder to get admitted into a physics PhD program. Therefore, I switch to materials science. While waiting for the results, I really think a lot about my personal interest and my future career path. I don't want to give up physics, but the reality shows that I failed to prove my ability to survive from physics phd studies. If I really got all rejections from physics programs, I will accept that outcome with calmness and then 100% concentrate on the materials science study. I am not competitive now doesn't mean that I will become a loser forever. Good luck to everyone who is struggling for a better future!

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

Special Bonus Points: Nope

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: None

Applying to Where:

Physics PhD (CME):
Pennsylvania State University: Rejected via email Mar. 14, email said they had around 500 applicants

University of British Columbia: I got an email from a professor asking if I'd like to do a skype chat, they aren't a member of the admissions committee, they just want to get to know me I guess, maybe a good sign? Rejected April 17th via email

Ohio State University: updated transcript requested Jan 9. Asked if I wanted to be added to a waitlist. I did - April 2nd Rejected April 17th via email

Georgia Institute of Technology:Rejected via email to check website 2/26, I saw that they listed a gpa limit of 3.5 somewhere, I'm just below that so I had been expecting this

University of Virginia: Mar 11 -Waitlisted via email to check website Rejected, April 18th via email to check website

North Carolina State University:Rejected April 15th.[color=#00BFBF] updated transcript requested Jan 22. Mar 25: I saw that a lot of people on here have heard from them, so I shot them an email and they let me know that they sent out the first round of acceptances and their just waiting till people get back to them to see if they'll have more spots.

University of Tennessee: Accepted!!! via email, Mar 4. 2 year teaching assistantship at $21500 per year. Additional $3500 per year fellowship for 2 years. Mar 11 - invited to department open house for March 29-30-Declined, 4/9

University of Georgia

Auburn University: ACCEPTED! Mar 18. $24270 GTA and additional $500 to "ease application and moving costs" Invited to visit on April 1st-Will Attend!

Clemson University: Invited to on-campus interviews Feb 14-16, received Jan 25 ACCEPTED!!-via email Mar 2. $23000 TA guaranteed for 5 years with additional $5000 fellowship for first year, and second year assuming satisfactory performance. Additional $5000 for summer 2020 if I do research with a specific biophysics professor. I expressed some interest in Biophysics while visiting there.

Others:
Dartmouth College Health Data Science MS:remote interview requested Dec 14, completed Jan 23.Rejected Via Email Feb. 25

Northern Arizona University Applied Physics MS: I've spoken and emailed with a professor who says I'm officially in but I haven't heard from the department or university yet.Accepted Mar 26th. $17500 for 20hrs/week GTA, health insurance provided.-Declined, 4/9

East Carolina University Biomedical Physics PhD/Medical Physics MS combined:Accepted Apr 9th. $18000 GTA, It also says I'd get an out-of state tuition waiver the first year and and an in state tuition waiver after that. Insurance provided.

Comments: I picked schools primarily based on region, you might notice. I feel like my application is probably weaker than a lot of people on this forum, so I tried to pick a good mix of schools to see where I could have an opportunity to continue my education. Some of them had free applications, like Auburn and that Dartmouth program, and Ohio State was only $5 I think, and NCSU waived their application fee. So I tried to cast a wide net. I've got at least two acceptances so now I've got a choice to make, which is it's own special challenge. I'm thinking that most of the people I haven't heard from yet have me on some kind waitlist and I'm not expecting too much. I'm still waiting to see exactly what choices I'll have, but I'll be sure to keep updating this as I go.

4/9: Today was pretty eventful, I turned down two places and got accepted to ECU. I applied to ECU mostly because I wasn't sure how I would fare with physics PhD programs and because that was a path that I had thought was slightly interesting, though I hadn't really explored it too much. I think that I've really gotten my decision narrowed down between Clemson and Auburn. The pay of medical physics is obviously extremely appealing, but I think that I'm going to stick with a physics PhD program. On another note, when I was applying I read A TON of these profiles and I felt like there aren't a ton of people with similar GPA's and Test scores or experience, so I wasn't super sure if the schools I was applying to were good picks. Now that I've got some results I feel like it was a good spread; there were some that I got into with nice fellowship offers and some that I got rejected from before too long, but OSU, NCSU, and UVA, and presumably UBC and UGA, have me on some form of a waitlist where they feel like I might be alright but I wasn't in their first round of admissions. It feels good to know that there are places that value the work I've put in as an undergrad.

4/15: I decided to attend Auburn! One of the most interesting things about this whole process is that I never anticipated not hearing from so many places by the time I made a decision. I thought about what would happen if I got accepted to all of them or rejected from all of them, but never did I imagine not hearing from so many so near the end. I decided to attend Auburn because I know from my visit and talking to professors there that I will be happy and hopefully I will be able to be successful there. I know that there are more prestigious programs out there, and maybe if I had waited longer I could have gotten into Ohio State or UBC or something, but my wife is from the south and we want to spend at least the next several years, and this will give us a chance to do that. Auburn is also in a more populous area than Clemson and as my wife looks for a job and stuff that should also help. I feel happy with my decision and I think that it will be an awesome place to be for the next few years. I'll continue to update this as I (hopefully) hear back from the remaining schools, and I'll add any insights that I can think of as this process moves further into the past. Best of luck to everyone in their future endeavors!

Notes
I am a bit of a weird applicant in that I heavily focused on hardware electronics during my undergrad and less on research. The schools I'm applying to all have good hardware labs/projects. My goal is to be doing detector design and implementation, ideally CMBR. I haven't found many applicants with a similar goal here, so hopefully this helps someone!

Afterthoughts (Feb 22):
Still waiting on UPenn but figure this won't change much even if I get in. I am frankly extremely happy with how this turned out! I applied to only 7 schools, all very top. There are a few reasons for this - physics in the US is predominantly data analysis/programming based, and while I have done such work before, I much prefer hardware and made that clear in my application. It was hard to gauge if this was a good or bad thing: fewer positions/projects are available for me to work on, but there are fewer people to compete with. Smaller universities also struggle to have the finance to develop detectors, and so that also forced me to apply to top universities with lots of funding and good reputation as they have the most options for me to work on. If I didn't get into a graduate school, I was going to take an internship or job offer and try again next year. I am a little burned out, and would only go to graduate school if it really worked out for me.

I'm very lucky that I heard from Caltech first. It frankly would have sucked to have heard all my rejections for the first half of February.

When applying to a bunch of colleges at the same general ranking, it becomes a bit of a crapshoot in terms of which ones you get into. In talking with professors at my own university, it became clear that there are a ton of other factors that influence admission - how big the previous year was, which professors can take on students, which departments are growing/shrinking, new professor hires, funding... Applicants have no control of this nor information about the current state of a university department and so I would encourage people to not analyze which ones they get into to gauge if they'll get into other ones. It's very difficult to say. Good luck to everyone now and whoever sees this in the future!

P: 830 (73rd percentile)


TOEFL: N/A


Research Experience:
Worked in a lab for roughly two years (began Nov. 2016) doing computational x-ray crystallography. Was paid for a summer by the lab and funded the next summer by the NSF-funded BioXFEL internship. No publications, although I did give a talk as a part of the internship and a technical report. I am currently working on a thesis in the field. The work I am doing for my thesis is likely to lead to two publications, although not before all applications are due.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions:
National Merit Scholar
National Hispanic Scholar

Pertinent Activities or Jobs:
Was a maths tutor teaching calculus for a summer camp one year. Also taught violin for a semester, worked as an undergraduate research assistant (see above), and served as a general officer + treasurer in my university's Society of Physics Students chapter.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

Special Bonus Points:
I guess I'm Hispanic, so I get to play the minority card. Two of my recommenders are prominent people in the BioXFEL consortium, and one has contacts at the Australian universities I'll be applying too (as well as Cornell). Have taken a few graduate classes and done well in them -- will take more next semester.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:
Terrible grades from Fall 2017-Fall 2018 due to chronic psychiatric issues starting in Summer 2017. If anything kills my applications, I expect it to be this. Yay depression + anxiety. At least one of my letter writers is aware and is willing to write about it, but we'll find out what admissions committees think. Also wrote at some length about music and how it fostered both my love of physics/mathematics and teaching. Not very technical, but might be interesting.

Undergrad Institution: Top 10 university and #1 Civil Engineering program in China, not well-known in physics
Major(s): Civil Engineering (my transcripts worry me most)
Minor(s):
GPA in Major:
Overall GPA: 4.52/5.0
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: about top 15%
Type of Student: International male, transitioning to Physics from a non-physics field

GRE Scores : (revised)
Q:167(91%)
V:154(65%)
W:3.0(17%) :oops:
P:990(94%) :D


TOEFL: 105(R: 30, L: 28, S: 19 :( , W: 28)


Research Experience:
- Quantum Mechanics research, starting from Sept. 2018. We are wrapping up and writing paper now, maybe will submit it soon (1st / 3 authors). This is an unexpected research experience because I never thought I would have a chance to work with a physicist when I'm still in school of civil engineering.
- 3 semesters of research on hysteresis behavior of reinforced concrete columns under strong seismic action. Not physics relevant, it is a research project in civil engineering. 1 paper submitted (2rd / 3 authors), and 1 paper in preparation (1st / 3 authors). I don't know how the admission office would evaluate my research experience in civil engineering.
- 1 normal presentation in Engineering Mechanics Institute, International Conference 2018, Nov. 2-4 (EMI-IC 2018). Still, it's about my civil engineering project

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Scholarship of Excellence in my university every year

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Help prepare and organize two international conferences, including EMI-IC 2018

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:
- I studied most physics and math undergraduate-level courses independently relying on materials in MIT/OCW, edX, Coursera, Caltech's class webpages and various other web sites. I think this experience will be considered since my PGRE score looks nice
- I had a physics research experience apart from research projects in school of Civil Engineering.
- I studied Japanese in my fresh year and transferred my major to Civil Engineering in my sophomore year. I finished three years credits in Civil Engineering in two years and started to study physics and math courses independently in my senior year.

Special Bonus Points:
- I have one letter from the physicist I'm now working with, and one letter from a professor famous in Engineering Mechanics
- First-generation college student

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: My motivation to study and do physics is manifest.

Colorado - Physics - CMT(Feb. 19: Rejected via website)
Penn. State - Physics - CMT, I withdrew the application on Mar. 10
University of Washington - Physics - HEP-th(Mar. 16: Rejected via email)

Comments:
Feb. 19: Transitioning to physics from a non-physics field is harder than I had thought. More preparation is needed to convinced the top graduate schools. Still working on it...
Feb. 27: Now the only hope would be UTokyo.
Mar. 4: I'm very lucky that UTokyo gives me offer. I guess the letter from the US professor really makes the difference! Although I haven't heard from UW and Penn. State, I think here are all offers. UTokyo's decision DDL is March 10, I'll start to consider between Georgetown and UTokyo now.
Mar. 11: UTokyo just gives us one week to make the decision, which makes it impossible to visit the school. I asked around for information about my potential supervisor, and all sounded nice. I know much about the Georgetown professor, and working with him is pleasant and rewarding. What's more, the financial support of Georgetown is nicer than that of Utokyo. I would say both options look good. Of course, the reputation of Utokyo is better, but Georgetown is in the US. After about one-week-long consideration, I decide Utokyo will work better for me. I probably will add more comments later.

Undergrad Institution: West Coast Big State, moderate physics reputation
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): Math
GPA in Major: 2.98 - 3.65
Overall GPA:
Length of Degree: 4 years undergrad, 1.5 years of grad with a decade in between (no MS, just classes, and its been 4+ years since then)
Position in Class:
Type of Student: White American Man
GRE Scores :

Q: 161
V: 160
W: 4.5
P: 790 (2017)


Research Experience: I worked with several groups for about a term each. I was all over the map; biophysics, astronomy, amorphous solids, x-ray diffraction, entanglement,and Morse theory, all 10+ years ago. Returning to a small school many years later there was really only time to take evening grad-level physics classes, although I did briefly try working with someone analyzing star formation data, and working with someone else on a high T superconductor problem, although that was more me trying to learn about the field and learning how to code more than anything. If I had more time I'd have liked to continue, the work itself was interesting. I did a class in Quantum Optics that was more like a research lab than a traditional class. I've been doing independent research for the past year or so, and have about a half-dozen projects (and 500 more ideas) that hopefully will turn in to something publishable, but pretty sure that doesn't count. Reading papers on arxiv leads to so many new ideas to work on.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: I'm honorless.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Math tutoring as an UG and working as a TA for physics for 1.5 years.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

Special Bonus Points: I've studied Norwegian for a long time, a very important language for physics, clearly.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I took classes at the master's level for about two years (3.65), then I changed jobs to something far less flexible. For the next year I enrolled in classes with the OK from work, but then they'd change things around and I never got to attend, despite them always saying "next week you can go to class, but we really need you here this week for project x, y, z..." Well I never got to campus once. Nearly a year of that. Shame on me for believing it term after term. 3.65 to 2.98, though I don't think those should count in the slightest. Uni won't remove them either, even with Prof. support acknowledging it. 99% sure this is what's stopping me, and if so, its a really stupid thing. I changed careers completely since then in order to have more time for my physics. I hope its not all for naught.

I've taken RQM as my highest official class, but I've worked through approaching 20 advanced textbooks (ie solving most problems) and have a comfortable working knowledge of QFT, GR, Stat Mech, Topology/homotopy, functional analysis, MBp, renormalization, various condensed matter topics. On my recent plate I'm learning AdS/CFT, CFT, Effective Field Theory, and a few others. I know many people have worked through lots of advanced books, but I'm still proud of that, it took a lot of time to do, and the result is I have a comfortable working knowledge in a number of advanced areas.

I'm not sure I'll get in anywhere, as my record indicates risk, but I think I have a few significant advantages over students fresh out of school, and my range of knowledge and problem solving abilities generally exceed most students at the same stage, but the GPA and dearth of any research experience more than a term or so is going to be a major obstacle that I won't have anymore opportunities to rectify, so I have to hope for the best at this point.

I chose schools that are doing several things I'm interested in and that covered a range of easier to harder to be admitted to. Even if I don't get in anywhere, I'm going to keep doing research no matter what I do for a living.

Research: 2.5 years research experience with a young but quite talented faculty(CMB/High Energy astronomy) including a summer research fellowship funded by the university. 2 years research experience with a member of Fermi LAT collaboration and paper in prep(N authors although...). 2 month at UMaryland for summer research on particle astrophysics.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Some but not important.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Two TA appointment at department of computer science(Yes... computer science. I am a man of programming). One one-month RA at department of math(just doing coding...)

Special Bonus Points: One of recommendation letters are probably quite strong.Two of the recommendation letters came from US researchers (Not that usual among International applicant) and all three recommendation letters came from people who has some reputation at High energy physics. A second major in statistics and CS related which is very useful for observational astronomy.

Applying in: particle astrophysics/High Energy astrophysics(observational).

Applying to Where:

U of Maryland, College Park - Physics -particle astrophysics(Accept 2/13 via email from commitee chair,finical support+$2.5k dean fellowship)

Backup plan:
HKU Mphil-(already got internal offer)

To be frank,I think my GPA probably make me very hard to get into US grad school since they admit student by the decision of admission committee.Usually for undergrad, GPA is the most straightforward for them to see the potential of that student as researcher... And since I already got internal offer from HKU, i didn't apply schools that are easy to get in. I expect I will get 0-1 offer from US grad school,Let see....

Perimeter is dream school, UC Berkeley is ideal for location reasons. I'm happy to get into any of these programs, not about that backup life, but if I'm rejected from all of them I'll apply to more European Unis, apply for more DOE lab positions (especially at LBNL) and take non-degree seeking courses, and apply to spring programs with research I'm into.

Looking bad for a PhD, trying not to be discouraged but nothing this late is a good sign of rejection. Guess I'm hoping for international and miracle funding, or another gap year.

Undergrad Institution: Large State School - very strong reputation in physics & astrophys
Major(s): Astophysics, Philosophy
Minor(s): Physics
GPA in Major: Astrophysics: 3.35, Philosophy: 3.62, Astronomy: 3.41, Physics: 3.29
Overall GPA: 3.47
Length of Degree: 4y (+bonus fall semester for extra physics courses and a grad class)
Position in Class: Maybe a bit above average? this is now available, top 20%
Type of Student: Domestic/White/Female

GRE Scores :
Q: 165 (88%)
V: 159 (83%)
W: 4.5 (82%)

Research Experience: A somewhat independent two year long astro project, resulted in 1st author publication in press and two posters presented. Currently on a different physics research project, hired full time until I head off to grad school. Was previously involved with a lab earlier in my undergrad and at my previous school (small liberal arts, one year) was involved in particle accelerator research. Also had a grant supported physics education research project for one year where I ended up producing lessons and tutorials that are still in use.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Latin honors - Magna Cum Laude (with a thesis research project), selected undergraduate representative on a departmental committee, one competitive in department scholarship for senior doing research, one school wide scholarship for pursuing STEM education for which I was nominated by my department and subsequently received.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Undergraduate TA for three courses, one where I taught my own recitations, two where I assisted and held office hours. Tutor in math, astronomy, physics, and philosophy.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: The first author paper & my philosophy major perhaps. Significant work in Python & MATLAB.

Special Bonus Points: Took grad math methods this semester to help fill in some holes in my math knowledge that affected early physics course performance. I expect very strong recommendation letters from people who genuinely think I am smarter than my grades and test scores show. I'm also a woman.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Attended a small liberal arts college for one year and then took a year off b/c I was miserable being in the middle of nowhere. I also got a C in EM2 with a terrible professor but retook and got an A- so hopefully they don't think I'm hopeless :|

Applying to Where:

Washington University in Seattle - Astronomy - (no interview requested) (Feb. 6: Rejected via website)
Carnegie Mellon University in Pitt - Physics - Astro/Cosmology - (Feb. 21: Rejected via email)
University of Michigan - Ann Arbor - Astrophysics & Astronomy - (Feb. 7: Rejected via email)
Columbia University in NYC - Astronomy - (no interview requested) (Feb. 1: Rejected via website, notified via email)
University of Wisconsin - Madison - Astronomy - Apr. 15: Accepted!! Will Attend!
Brown University - Physics - Astro/Cosmology - (Mar. 6: Rejected via email)
University of Pittsburgh - Physics - Astro/Cosmology - (Informed of waitlist position via email with POI, confirmed Mar. 21 via email)
Vanderbilt - Astrophysics - (Apr. 13.: Rejected via email)
Denver University - Physics & Astronomy - Astro/Cosmology - Mar. 25: Accepted via email!

I've combed these pages in the past to give myself hope that I could still go to grad school. They've given me a smidgen and I want mine to do the same for you. I'm applying a bit all over the place but chose to do this so that no matter where I go, I will be happy with the location and the program -- assuming I get in anywhere. Fingers crossed!


Final Thoughts:
On the process: This sucked for me. I was very stressed and constantly checking gradcafe.com and this site to see what was happening with other people. To future applicants, instead of doing that, spend that energy reading the work of people you want to work with and reaching out to the faculty with well thought out comments and explain why you are interested in working in their group. I have no doubt that my second offer was a result of reaching out and developing good connections with people at the school throughout this whole process. At another school, I developed another a genuine connection that did not lead to an acceptance but did mean I had someone advocating for my application throughout the review even though I had never worked with the faculty member.
On picking schools: Do not apply to a school you do not want to attend. I would have been thrilled to go anywhere I applied and so every rejection hurt but the acceptances both felt amazing.
On the field: Grad astro has become very competitive. Every program I was in dialog with mentioned this and their lower than normal number of positions because of previously larger than anticipated classes. Most had a ratio of 3-4 spots or lower to >150 applicants. That works out to admitting 6-7 people or less than a 5% acceptance ratio, which is wild.
On Astro vs Physics with astro: I worried that by choosing an Astronomy program, I could disadvantage my future self versus getting a Physics PhD. I asked a lot of people about this throughout the process. I found that no faculty found this to be a well founded fear. This was especially not well founded as I want to go into academia and am planning on taking Physics courses in my Astro track anyways. People agreed that if I was trying to go into industry that Physics PhD might be viewed differently in some sectors but that it would be rare and that my courses taken would be what mattered most.
On prepping to apply: Diversify your research background. Don't stay with one project forever. Try different things and find stuff you love. In many of my astro interviews, my Philosophy background came up and gave me a unique perspective. Have fun in college.
And in the end... I'm very thankful. Good luck.

Undergrad Institution: Colombian Private University (Descent reputation in physics)
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): Phiosophy and Math
GPA in Major: 3.61
Overall GPA: 3.61
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: near top
Type of Student: Male International

GRE Scores : most recent
Q: 162 (80%)
V: 152 (80%)
W: 4.0 (59%)
P: 910 (85%)


TOEFL: (R: 30 , L: 29 , S: 30 , W: 28 )


Research Experience: I worked in high energy physics for one year at my university (there were no publications and I had to leave the group), I took part in a summer research fellowship for undergraduates at the U.S. in which I studied antihydrogen atoms inside the ALPHA magnetic trap at CERN (from this there a manuscript for a publication) and finally I am part of two research groups at my university: Quantum Information and Quantum Mechanics, and Statistical Mechanics.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: I was awarded three scholarships two from the national government and one from my institution. And I received two awards nationally and one in my institution due to my good academic standing.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: I was able to work in my institution as a teaching assistant for several courses and I was able to be an academic tutor in physics for around a year and a half in my institution.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

Special Bonus Points:

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:

Applying to Where:


Stanford - Physics - Theoretical Physics REJECTED Feb 20-email
Cornell - Theoretical Physics REJECTED Feb 25-email
MIT - Physics - Theoretical Physics REJECTED Feb 12-email
Princeton - Physics - Theoretical Physics REJECTED Feb 12-email
New York University - Theoretical Physics

UC Santa Barbara - Theoretical Physics REJECTED Feb 26-email to check website
UC San Diego - Theoretical Physics
Purdue - Theoretical Physics ACCEPTED Feb 26-email with offer letter-20k/9months TA

The whole process was quite stressful and expensive, but I hope I will pass somewhere and that the whole thing was worth it.
Edit thoughts Feb 12: As I didn’t get any emails requesting interviews I am not surprised I didn’t get into MIT or Princeton. I won't lie and say I didn’t want to be surprised, but the outcome was expected. Still somewhat sad.

Edit thoughts Feb 20: This is getting utterly disappointing

______________________________________________
Undergrad Institution: (School or type of school, such as big state, lib arts, ivy, technical, foreign (what country?)... Overall Reputation in Physics?): University of British Columbia - Okanagan Campus, somewhat unheard of, gets confused with UBC proper a lot, which can be good or bad.
Major(s): Honours Physics, Honours Mathematics
Minor(s):
GPA in Major: A average
Overall GPA: A-/B+ average
Length of Degree: 5 years
Position in Class: Near Top
Type of Student: (Domestic/International, male/female, minority?) Domestic white male (so scandalous)

GRE Scores : (revised or old version?)
Q:170 (96%)
V:154 (65%)
W:4.5 (82%)
P: 830 (73%)


TOEFL: (R: , L: , S: , W: ) NA


Research Experience: I had only conducted research as an honours project for physics. This was 8 hours/week and only for 1 year, no publication came out of it. In high school I did a lot of work and got a patent and 2 publications. I included this in all of my applications but it was done in high school and not in the correct field of research I am applying for (this was in ergonomics).

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: I was on the deans list for the past 3 years

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: I have been a teaching assistant for the past 3 years. The past 2 years I have been teaching 2nd year physics classes.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: I have been heavily involved in the math/physics/stats/comp sci course union at my university. I have been the physics representative and vice president (each were 1 year titles).

Special Bonus Points: 2/3 of my recommendations will be extremely good. The last one will be good but wont be a falling from the heavens into the lap of the admissions department as the other 2 will.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:

Applying to Where: I applied to the physics department, under experimental condensed matter physics for a PhD for all of the below unless otherwise stated.

University of California Santa Barbara - (Rejected (March 1st ish) Asked to check website)
University of California San Diego - (Rejected in email)
University of British Columbia - Masters Program (no direct PhD) - (Jan 29: Accepted via email, offered 25k stipend (CAD))
University of Alberta - (Dec 20: Accepted via website/email, offered 33.5k stipend (CAD) wants to hear response by Jan 18th and I asked for an extension - moved to March 22.)
University of Toronto - (Dec 20: Accepted via website/email, offered 28k stipend (CAD))
New York University - (Rejected asked to check website)

I was fairly confused by these admissions results, mainly because I thought UBC and Toronto would be harder to get into (as they are ranked higher than the US schools). Maybe the sub par GRE scores played a larger role than I thought? I am quite happy to "settle" for either UBC or Toronto. UBC has more research in what I am interested in specifically (it is actually my top choice of everywhere I applied).

Special Bonus Points: I have done research with all three of my letter writers and they should all be very positive.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:

Applying to Where: All for CM/AMO Theory

MIT - Physics (Feb. 12: Rejected via email)
Harvard - Physics (Feb. 25: Rejected via email)
Princeton - Physics (Feb. 12: Rejected via email)
Yale - Physics (Feb. 13: Rejected via email)
Cornell - Physics (Feb. 25: Rejected via email)
UMD - Physics (Feb. 14: Rejected via email)

Lehigh - Physics (Feb. 08: ACCEPTED for Ph.D via email + 3 year fellowship $34,000/year) Declined

Update:

Ultimately, I decided to take a year off and apply to schools again next year. Although I received acceptances, I am now realizing that my choice of graduate school will define my future career, so I should go to the best school I can possibly get into. My statements of purpose could be more well defined as I probably sounded like I didn't really know what I wanted to study in graduate school. Additionally, I have no publications or significant research accomplishments which I can hopefully get in my year off. I will be continuing my undergraduate research while taking more time to find schools that are a better fit for me. This will also give me an opportunity to better define what exactly I'm interested in studying in graduate school and why I want to get my PhD. I thought my PGRE score would matter more, but I guess it doesn't. Research seems to be the most important factor by far and it is hard to stand out when coming from a school with little to no physics reputation. I have learned the hard way that I am not cut out for top 10 schools and I should adjust my selection of schools accordingly. Hopefully I'll have better luck next year.

Undergrad Institution: top school in China, PKU. good reputation in physics, but not sure if it is well known in US
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): N/A
GPA in Major: 3.71
Overall GPA: 3.68
Length of Degree: 4
Position in Class: around 30% I assume
Type of Student: Asian Male

GRE General: Verbal 155, Q: 170, AW: 3.5
PGRE: 990
Toefl: 107 (29L,30R, 26W, 22S :? )

Research Experience: All in Biophysics. first last half year from sophomore to junior in PKU(quit without recommendation letter, I have to say the professor is not kind enough, a little mean.), deep learning techniques applied to cryoEM. second, junior to senior year, some topics about nonlinear dynamics and statistical physics. third, from August,2018 to now, with a US professor affiliated to PKU about free energy, stochastic physics and biophysics.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: two scholarship.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: None.

Special Bonus Points: Letter of recommendation come from professor who direct my last two REU, they seem to be very satisfied about my performance. But it seems to me that US faculties quite underestimate the recommendation from Chinese professor, even from top University(compared with US and Europe), really bad news for me.

Applying to Where:
All orientation in biophysics and statistical physic theory if not specified
Yale physics (Feburary 14, Rejected )
Cornell physics(Feburary 20, Rejected via email)
UPenn physics (soft matter)
Michigan physics (February 12, Rejected via email )
UIUC physics（February 21 Accepted via email） (Will Attend!)
UCSB physics
University of Maryland physics (also mentioned nonlinear physics) (Feburary 14, Accepted, $5k fellowship) (Really a good relief for me)
UCSD physics
CU Boulder physics (chemical physics, soft matter) Feburary 19,Rejected Never thought that. I assume it as safety school, now I know I am too arrogant.

Feburary 20: After rejected by Cornell, I am a little disappointed about the result of my application. After some fight about my vanity, I told myself that Maryland is good enough for me to become a great scientists if I work hard, I will have great platform there. I believe I will succeed there. (When I am saying this, I definitely have no hope for other school I apply to. I even doubt I get this offer by luck, since as I know most of my classmates have done undergraduate exchange research in US top universities to prepare for their application.)

Feburary 21: A good day! I get the offer from UIUC. This is the very best school which I want to get in when I begin my application! I guess that's it!
Hope everyone have great offer! :D

Undergrad Institution: State school, no reputation in physics (usnews rank ~70)
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): None
GPA in Major: 3.74
Overall GPA: 3.7
Length of Degree: 5 years
Position in Class: Top 4 out of about 15
Type of Student: Domestic white male

GRE Scores :
Q: 158 (68%) :cry:
V: 154 (65%)
W: 4
P: 640 (36%) :cry: :cry: :cry:


Research Experience:
- 1 summer + 1 semester in computational condensed matter group. Did some coding and presented a poster.
- 2 summers + part time for 2 semesters in material science lab working on OLEDs.
- 1 semester (post-bacc) internship in nuclear physics at national lab. Poster presented and paper submitted to arXiv
- Currently doing another internship at a national lab in quantum materials.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions:
- Mini-grant that funded one of my summer research projects
- Fellowship for funding the other summer research project
- Endowment I received for GPA my sophomore year when I was a chemE major prior to switching to physics (provided through school alumni)
- About 5 scholarships for GPA (each lasted several years, allowing me to fund myself until graduation)

All the above awards/scholarships were through my school.


Pertinent Activities or Jobs: 1 semester physics tutor

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I'm worried about B's in my atomic physics, thermal physics, and optics courses. Also, during my junior year I took some abstract math courses and got B's

Applying to Where:

Indiana University - Physics - Condensed Matter Experiment - 1/31: Unofficial acceptance via Email, roughly $17,000/yr
University of Michigan - Applied Physics - Condensed Matter/Quantum Information - 2/14: Acceptance via Email, fully funded and received a fellowship through the graduate school. - Will attend

UMD College Park - Physics - Quantum Information/Condensed Matter Experiment - 2/14: Rejection via Email - Expected.
CU Boulder - Physics - Quantum Information/Condensed Matter Experiment - 2/18: Rejection via Email to check website - Expected.
University of Washington - Physics - Quantum Information/Condensed Matter Experiment - 3/15: Rejection via Email - Expected.
Penn State University - Physics - Condensed Matter Experiment - 3/15: Rejection via Email Was hoping to get in, not too disappointed though because of my other acceptances.
Stony Brook University - Physics - Condensed Matter Experiment - 4/9: Rejection via Email

Boston University - Physics - Condensed Matter Experiment - No response as of 4/17.

Thoughts: I was accepted to my top choice and rejected from pretty much everywhere else. This is unsurprising because I put significantly more effort into my Michigan application than the rest. Despite low GRE scores, I think I was accepted because I had a few research experiences under my belt and my statement of purpose was probably one of my best pieces of writing (I heavily emphasized my interest in applied physics and technology as opposed to more fundamental physics research). Also, Michigan is big on OLED and renewable energy research, which I have some background in.

Undergrad Institution: One of the best engineering colleges in my country. Not as famous for physics, but quite a few alumni went on to join great schools.
Major(s): Physics (integrated Master's degree, no intermediate Bachelor's)
GPA in Major: 9.1/10
Overall GPA: 8.88/10
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: Top five in my class of 70
Type of Student: International male

GRE Scores :
Q: 170 (97th percentile)
V: 161 (88th percentile)
W: 4.5 (82nd percentile)
P: 910 (86th percentile)


TOEFL: (R: 30/30, L: 29/30, S: 30/30, W: 26/30)


Research Experience: Master's thesis on integrable systems (6 months) and post-grad research assistantship on partition functions of supersymmetric gauge theories (6 months, ongoing) in two of the best institutes for physics in my country - these projects gave me a lot of exposure to advanced mathematics as well; a project in my university (4 months) on quantum chaos and OTOCs; a remote internship (long-drawn-out) on computational astrophysics with a professor from another country back in my third year. I'm interested in string theory, gauge/gravity duality, AdS/CFT integrability, and topics of mathematical physics like T-duality (mirror symmetry) and Hitchin functionals.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Got a government scholarship for my higher education because of my secondary school performance. Nothing phenomenal after that.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: None.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Nope.

Special Bonus Points: Did a very small project with a CMT legend in one of the institutes, who's unfortunately not a recommender. Took QFT and GR classes in my university and audited them in the institute in which I'm currently working (GR taught by a string theory legend, but probably doesn't count).

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Have a C from a lab course (which I hated, but this is my fault) and a couple of Bs, but the fact that I've done well in courses that directly matter to my interests should hopefully see me through.

Applying to Where: Applying only for HEP-th.

Reach:

UT Austin - Rejected via Website on April 9 (What a horrendously long wait)
Stony Brook - Rejected via E-mail on February 25 (I sent an email to the graduate program coordinator who informed me)
Penn State (reach for string theory) - Accepted via E-mail on February 8 - $22K TA stipend for first year + $3K fellowship + $4K support for summer (I just saw this since it was lost in my inbox)
U. Pennsylvania (don't know if that's much of a reach for HEP-th) - Rejected via Website on March 19 (Got an email to check status on website)
U. British Columbia (Master's) (borderline reach; I really want to get in here) - Rejected via E-mail on February 16 (I sent an email to the graduate program coordinator who informed me; I'm quite gutted since this was my top choice)

SISSA (International School for Advanced Studies) - Invited to write the written examination; didn't attend
Queen Mary University of London

Match:

Duke University - Rejected via E-mail on February 25 (Email to check website)
UC Davis
U. Michigan, Ann-Arbor - Rejected via E-mail on February 15 (I've heard that there's little to no HEP-th funding this year; I wish I knew that before I applied)
U. Wisconsin, Madison - Rejected via Website on January 30 (UWM doesn't have a big string theory group, so I'm not surprised)
U. Southern California - Rejected via E-mail on February 22
Texas A&M

Safety:
Brown University - Rejected via Website on February 25 (Got an email to check status on website)

Edit - Mar 08: The dominoes are falling! I am just glad to have offers from a couple of programs. I did not have a lot of confidence in my applications, given my undergrad GPA. To those who are in similar boat -> take note that your Masters performance and your research experience when coupled with an impressive Physics GRE score can outweigh your low undergrad GPA. At 27, I am one of the older applicants, but your age does not matter to an extent if you have other positive elements in your resume.

Edit - Mar 26:
This whole process was very nerve-racking.

To those with sub-optimal GPA: make sure everything else on your resume is so great that the admissions committee have to think twice before they reject you. Maybe get a Masters if you can afford it. I could because in my home country, it is relatively cheaper than in the US.
To those who have other deficiencies: one deficiency is not difficult to overcome given other parts of your resume shine through.

Btw, my SOP was 4 pages long. I had to tell them all about what I offer them and why I had a bad undergrad GPA. I think that some schools may not have read through my SOP due to its length. Anything shorter would not have given them all the information to make an informed decision and most likely would have led to a rejection. In fact the extra length of my SOP probably helped me in my acceptances - specially schools that do not receive a large number of applicants.

List of universities: apply to a range of universities and make sure to have maybe five places where you think you should surely get in. Add other universities after you have made this "safety net". Also apply by location. In my experience, geography matters a lot. Better exposure to job opportunities outside academia is essential because most of us will probably not make it to a post-doc or two.

International candidates: Your Physics GRE is probably the most important part of your application. Make sure to do well. Then you must also show them at least acceptable English proficiency - try to get at least a 160 on the verbal section and a 4.0 on the writing section. If you get these scores in the general GRE, TOEFL will take care of itself.

Also, I wish I had known about this website during my undergrad days. I found it out just last year, after I had finished my Masters. If you are reading this, make sure to share this great website with fellow students at your program wherever you are.

This process was very hard. I was flipping coins and I haven't slept in a month. Here is my advice for future prospective graduate students.

The graduate school rankings are important to some degree. If you want to stay in academia then going to Harvard, Berkeley and Stanford are a must if you are accepted. If you get into them the school names speak for themselves. Just look at where faculty are from on department websites. Outside of the top five or six schools the rankings are kinda BS. Certain schools will specialize in certain fields and the specific department you are interested in may be very strong but not highly ranked. What is important is the specific professor and that you like the work they do.

If you don't know where to begin when applying to schools, then look go down the list of rankings but look at each department's webpage. Go to each school and count how many groups do the work you are interested in. Check their quality by looking at publications and see what you are interested in. There is no good into getting into a top 20 school (whatever that biased ranking means) but then finding out that they don't have what you are looking for. This is what happened to me at UCLA. I loved the location and I wanted to be in California but there were only three experimental condensed matter groups even though it is ranked as a top 20 school.

I chose Yale because it had experimental condensed matter groups which also did theory. This is what I am looking for. I am not thrilled about New Haven, CT. I still don't feel happy about my decision because California has always been my dream, but I had to sacrifice the location for the physics. Maybe you'll see me on this forum in another year if I don't like it. But lets hope that everything goes well. I chose the school for the ivy name as well.

Overall, I never wish this process on my worst enemy. I am lucky that I had choices, but the process was still very hard. There's also pseudo randomness in the acceptances. I can't see how I got into some schools over others. I'll give a quick summary of the schools I visited if anyone else is looking for opinions on which schools to apply to in the future.

Yale - good quantum computing and I really like the applied physics program.
CU Boulder - an AMO dream of endless labs, Nobel laureates, and NIST and JILA are right on campus.
UCLA - good plasma and HEP.
Georgia Tech - Truthfully, I wasn't impressed. But astronomy seems cool here.
Duke - good meta material condensed matter research. I didn't go to the open house so I can't say much, just visited on another day.

Undergrad Institution: Top 10 in the UK University
Major(s):Physics (MPhys)
Minor(s): N/A
GPA in Major:3.85
Overall GPA:3.85
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: Not a clue, not measured
Type of Student: International (UK student)

GRE Scores : Revised I think? (Did it all on a PC)
Q: 167 (91%)
V: 159 (83%)
W: 4.5 (82%)
P: 880 (81%)


TOEFL: Waived


Research Experience: Spent a year in the US as part of study abroad, during which I spent a year working on an independent research project on the cloaking of optical fibres. This work went towards an honours thesis and was also presented at a university level conference. After that I got a paid summer internship at my home institution developing a method of thermometery for low temperature experiments. This work was presented at a small national conference. At the time of application I was working on my masters project on the effect of aerogel on superfluid He-4. I have also completed a literature review on superfluids as part of my degree.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: The only official recognition I got was a certificate of excellence in undergraduate research at my study abroad institution.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: None related to physics, some basic customer facing roles in past years which I didn't mention on my application.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: I had an active part as a cultural ambassador during my study abroad, however this was a very minor part of my application.

Special Bonus Points: I have taken graduate level courses as part of my masters in semiconductors, quantum transport, advanced magnetism and low temperature physics. However I didn't have any grades for these when applying. My masters supervisor and people I work with in the lab are very well known in low temperature physics (apparently it's a small circle), this should help when applying to University of Florida and Cornell. The people I work with as part of my masters project know people at Florida and Cornell personally, two of which wrote my letters of recommendation. I did contact a potential supervisor at Florida and at Cornell, both seemed very interested due to my work with superfluids, the one at Cornell especially so.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: None come to mind.

Applying to Where:

School - UNC Chapel Hill - CME (Accepted Jan. 18: for Ph.D. Accepted via website/email + $22.5k/11 month TA)
School - Cornell University - CME
School - CU Boulder- CME/AMO
School - Duke University - CME (Accepted Jan. 23: for Ph.D. Accepted via website/email + $31.8k/2 semesters TA)
School - University of Florida - CME

All of my applications were tailored to the specific university and why the work I did fits well with what they do and what I hope to do. In my limited experience, I think this is what is most likely to get you an acceptance. I have been told applying is like a lottery and that may be true. Applying and the wait was very stressful but getting that first acceptance was a huge relief. I'd be happy to answer any questions anyone has for me.

***I'm an average guy, didn't study at all for these exams, and only took them once. I even sat down with a Rice professor and he told me they don't look at the regular GRE and are only worried about the physics GRE if less that 10 percentile. He did say they would be more impactful on ivy league schools, but dat aint me***



Research Experience: 8 months of research in particle physics focusing on detectors and still continuing. Our university collaborates with LHC so I got a very in depth view of how they operate and do research. 1 REU poster. I decided to graduate in 3 years which is the better choice financially, but wish I had a little more time doing research.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Academic excellence, private scholarship based on merit and essay

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: TA for introductory physics 2 during my last two semesters, private tutor

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

Special Bonus Points: 1 professor with significant contributions in neutrino detections, 1 is a distinguished and award winning math professor, the other guy just liked me and had a connection at one of the schools I am applying to lol

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Just solid work ethic and the fact that I'm a 20 year old applicant. I worked up to 3 jobs at a time during the semester, one being at 4am every day. I also worked pretty hard on my statement of purposes, started writing them the summer and had multiple professors revise and edit them for me. I explained how my occupational circumstances didn't leave me much time to study and mentioned professors I emailed or talked to in person.

Undergrad Institution: Mid-size private school, "Hidden Gem" Physics reputation (BONUS: Paul Dirac taught here :D )
Major(s): Mechanical Engineering and Applied Physics
Minor(s): N/A ( I almost did Math, but was one course short )
GPA in Major: 4.00
Overall GPA: 4.00
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class:Not known but probably near the top
Type of Student: Domestic male; sort of a minority but did not stress on application

GRE Scores : revised version
Q: 168 (94%)
V: 163 (93%)
W: 6.0 (99%) :o Surprise!
P: 780 (62%) :mrgreen: That's what happens when you are "Applied" Physics vs. just Physics


Research Experience: Research all performed at my school, about 3.5 years in a Biophysics lab. No publications but in the very final stages of putting out a first author publication to a pretty good journal. Project was almost entirely independent of my P.I. , which was apparently stressed in my letter of recommendation. Gave lots of conference talks (and a few poster presentations), including one in Iceland my Junior year :D

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Summa Cum Laude, President of the Astronomy Club, a few "somethings list" here and there but I haven't really kept track. I have one hell of a senior design project for my Mechanical Engineering degree.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: I was a TA for one engineering class, but I did not mention this on any of my applications.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: I had a senior design project which was completely focused on ice core drilling, which is sort of related to the field of study I applied for (Geophysics). Wherever the document "Supplemental Materials" was asked for in my applications; I put my final report for this course in that section.

Special Bonus Points: No real bonus points; I e-mailed professors I was interested in working with ahead of time and tried to take the hardest possible physics and engineering courses (and as many graduate courses) as I could while I was at my University. I got one hell of a recommendation letter from my advisor in my research lab

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: So I applied for two completely different types of programs: Geophysics and Medical Physics. This might sound like a bad idea from the onset (like spreading myself a bit too thin), but actually I do really have a passion for both of these fields and have some level of background in either subject. I made two separate personal statements to this end: and revised both statements so extensively that by the end (when the applications were ready to be submitted), I had a pretty good understanding of what I wanted to do in graduate school in either field, with good detail. I also sort of followed the philosophy of "if I apply to more schools, I'm more likely to get in", rather than " if I apply to a few schools and spend more time making good applications, I'm more likely to get in ".

Applying to Where:

CalTech - Geophysics (Jan. 22: Accepted for Ph.D. Accepted via email + $35k Fellowship, 3/7 WILL ATTEND
Stanford -Geophysics - Glaciology (Jan 14: Invited to attend interview on Campus)REJECTED (March 3rd) :roll:
UCLA - Physics and Biology in Medicine - Radiation Therapy (Jan 15: Invited to attend interview on Campus), WITHDRAWN, WILL NOT ATTEND
University of Miami - Medical Physics (Jan. 30: Accepted for PhD. Had to check website + 2 Year Fellowship (29k per year) plus A number of smaller stipends), WILL NOT ATTEND
Oxford University -Radiation Biology - (Jan 21: Invited to attend interview)UPDATE: Interview went quite well ...[/color] (Feb. 8: Accepted for MSc. Accepted via email +$14,777 stipend + $7500 home and EU fees), Update: Funding withdrawn?!?!?! Okay, well, not going here... :roll:
National University of Ireland Galway - Medical Physics - Radiation Therapy(Jan 18: Invited to attend interview) UPDATE: Interview went quite well ...(Jan. 30: Accepted for MSc. Accepted via email WILL NOT ATTEND)

RPI -Physics -(Jan. 22: Accepted for Ph.D. Accepted via email, Awaiting further Funding Information), WILL NOT ATTEND
Lund University - Physics
University of Copenhagen - Medical Physics (Mar 27: Accepted for MSc. Accepted via email, Tuition Waiver + $13200 per year stipend ), WILL NOT ATTEND
University of British Columbia, Okanagen - Medical Physics
University of Victoria - Medical Physics (Mar 5: Invited to attend interview on Campus), Declined Interview
McGill University - Medical Physics (Jan. 22: Accepted for MSc. Accepted via email, Awaiting further Funding Information), WILL NOT ATTEND
Harvard -Geophysics REJECTED February 22 :roll:
Princeton -Geophysics- (Jan 23: Invited to attend "Quick Chat" with professor in the department) (Feb. 8: Accepted for Ph.D. Accepted via email, 29K Stipend+6k First two-year bonus+ 8k summer fellowship),
University of Wisconsin -Atmospheric Sciences (Jan. 22: Accepted for Ph.D. Accepted via email, Awaiting further Funding Information), WILL NOT ATTEND

Overall thoughts?:

The application process to graduate school was a very long and, sometimes, very tiresome process. In total I probably dedicated about $1500 and many, many hours of my time filling out applications, editing essays, studying for the GRE, flying all over the country, and finally, thinking about my final decision. In all, the offer from Caltech seemed to make the most financial and logistical sense, plus, Its hard for me to get past the 'cool' factor of Caltech and the fact that JPL is right across the corner. In all, I would say all that work was well worth it, but I hope I won't have to do it again for a while.

Good luck to everyone else starting their PhD this fall! :D

A few thoughts:

0) I did not mention this in my applications, but I almost dropped out of my degree because of mental health issues. I'm better now, but it made me lose my momentum. I used to have huge plans and ambition and ended up having no confidence in my chances of making it in grad school. 6 months ago, I didn't even want to apply to US universities because I thought it would be useless, but one of my supervisors pushed me. Ended up rushing the PGRE, GRE and TOEFL back to back, the same week as my mid-terms, at the last minute and without studying. I still have a hard time believing how positive the outcome was. Moral of the story: No matter what people say around you or online, no matter what that annoying, judgy, voice in your head tells you, go all-in. You have nothing to loose.

1) People told me that applying to Stanford and. al with a 840 PGRE was useless. Rubbish.

2) People told me that taking an extra year to complete my degree would ruin my chances. Double Rubbish. It allowed me to get extra research exp., to have all of my grades in my transcript in time for applications, to take some time to take care of myself and even to squeeze in a little extra volunteering work, all of which I believe helped my case.

3) I believe the most important part of your application are your recommendation letters. I was told by multiple people that this was the most impressive part of my application. All three of my letters were from people with whom I worked closely and on a daily basis, and who knew me very well. A recommendation letter from someone who can vouch for the quality of your research work is worth infinitely more than a letter from a renowned person who doesn't know you very well.

4) Personnalize your application to the uni you are applying to. Mention specific names of researchers whose work you find interesting and link their research interests to your skills, even if you have not contacted them before applying. Explain why you applied to that specific program: relate the dept. to a personnal story, like a talk given by a faculty which you attended or someone you know who studied there. If it sounds like the dpt you are applying to is just another one on your list, you will be just another average applicant on theirs.

5) Have a coherent story. Even if you don't really know what you want to do for your graduate studies, make it sound like you know where you are headed and like you have a plan. Most unis will require a researcher or a member of the selection commitee to vouch for you in order to make it in. If it seems like you are unsure about your future field, you become a risky investment. In most places, it is pretty easy to change direction once you are in.

6) If you are applying in exp. physics, people with skills in ML/AI are actively sought after. A graduate or online ML course is a good investment.

Research Experience:
I did 2 years of research in one lab, working on radio based, ultra-high energy neutrino detectors. First year was on hardware, involving soldering, machining, cable-making, and integration to prepare the stations for deployment in Antarctica. The second year, I worked on applying genetic algorithms to evolve ideal antennas for these detectors. I first evolved gain and phase patterns using thirteen spherical harmonic coefficients. Now, I work with others to evolve the physical antenna parameters using antenna and in-ice neutrino simulations. Got one biology publication from my heavy biology research the summer after freshman year, and one physics paper in hardware. Over the past summer, I got paid to to work with three other students to bring a machine learning class to our department, and there I learned a lot about writing CNNs, AEs, VAE,s as well as many ML techniques. Attended TeVPa and APS, and plan to present our group's efforts at APS April in Denver this semester.

GRE Scores : (revised)
Q: 162 (80%)
V: 168 (98%)
W: 5.5 (98%)
P: 590 (25%) :oops: (Didn't send to any schools that didn't absolutely REQUIRE it)


Research Experience: About 3.5 years (including summers) doing theoretical research on black holes, general relativity, hawking radiation, holography, and currently quantum gravity. My school has an undergraduate thesis requirement so I think that gives me a leg up.

V: 162 (91st percentile)
W: 4.5 (82nd percentile)
P: 750 (59th percentile)

Not a good test taker under pressure.

Research Experience: 4 summer internships, 2 with reputable groups in Germany (relevant to the field I am applying in - also the PIs of these internships were my referees). 2 semester long master thesis work.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: 1 conference talk, 1 seminar talk at the German university.

RPI - Withdrawn 2/20/19

2/1- I was a little uneasy about not having a published paper yet (and taking an extra semester), but I still got accepted to one of my top choices. Huge relief, and I'm super stoked!

2/15 - Tough second week. Two rejections, and it seems the first round offers for UCSB, Harvard, UIUC, and Berkeley have already gone out. Back down to Earth, I guess...

2/26 - Well, that's that. Multiple years in the making, and just like that it's over.
Truthfully, this played out pretty much exactly as I expected - rejected by most of the elite schools I applied to (but a few acceptances based on the number I applied to), and accepted by almost all the schools in the middle/bottom of my list. I spent a lot of time over the last couple years researching and preparing for this process, and it was nice to see it bear some fruit. I'm saddened by some of the rejections (especially those top three...), but ultimately I have some great offers from fantastic schools, and I'm thrilled with the results. Can't wait to do visits next month.

4/10 - Caltech it is!! Ultimately I felt they had by far the most research options, and the setting in Pasadena blows the other options away. I'm relieved to be done with the decision process, and can finally just get excited!

Takeaways/Advice for future applicants
Some thoughts/observations I have they may help others:

    You don't need to come from an elite undergrad to go to an elite grad program.
    You need great grades, strong research experience/LORs, and strong GRE scores regardless of where you come from. If you've got these things, where you did them won't be of huge importance.
    Taking extra time to finish your degree can be helpful.
    Provided you have proportional extra accomplishments. In my case, I was able to get an REU with the extra summer and fit in a graduate course, so taking an extra semester greatly boosted my application.
    You don't need a published paper to get into an elite school.
    This was my #1 concern about my applicant profile, as it was really the only thing I was missing. It turns out my fears were fairly justified (I was rejected from 4 of my top 5 choices), and publications really are important for most of those cream of the crop schools (especially for theory). Fortunately, it didn't keep me out completely, which was a relief. So it is possible, but definitely better to be published if you're shooting high.
    You don't need to reach out to faculty.
    I didn't reach out to anyone at any of the places I was accepted to and, incidentally, I was rejected from the only two places I did talk to people at. If you're able to reach out and make a meaningful connection to a professor where you're applying, that will definitely go a long way, but it's by no means necessary.
    Check the applicant numbers/acceptance rates on schools.
    I didn't do this until after I got my results, but a search on gradschoolshopper.com or petersons.com reveals that the big-name schools I got into (Caltech, Cornell, UIUC) all have higher acceptance rates (but still low, around ~20%) and fewer applicants than the schools I got rejected from. In retrospect, this would've been a nice gauge to base my expectations on, though I doubt it would've changed my list.
    Apply to a lot of schools.
    If you can afford it, apply to a lot of schools. This process is inherently pseudorandom, and in my opinion it's best to throw a lot of darts at once and hope one lands on the board.



Well, that ended up being longer than I intended. Hope this helps someone in the future!

W: 5.0 (92%)
P: 970 (92%)


TOEFL: 115 (R: 28, L: 29, S: 28, W: 30) (Did not study for this. Only the most pesky programs needed it, so had to give it again as these scores are only valid for two years)


Research Experience: 3 month summer research in Soft Condensed Matter Physics - Experimental (SCMP-E) at the end of Sophomore year, followed by a ~1.5 year experience in another SCMP-E lab with a focus on fluid dynamics. At the end of junior year, sought collaboration with an applied mathematician for simulation work. Dabbled for 3 months in a CMP experimental lab (spintronics) during the middle of my junior year. Did a university Summer UROP at the end of my junior year in the fluid dynamical SCMP-E lab. Currently finishing up with my honors thesis. Doing meteorological research with NASA for about 5 months now. One publication related to mathematical physics during the application period (which just got accepted for publication), one university symposium oral presentation.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Deans Honor List, Phi Beta Kappa, Pi Mu Epsilon

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Grader in an upper-division Math class, Tutor in a lower-division Physics class, couple on-campus leadership positions in my sophomore year.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

Special Bonus Points: My advisor suggested some universities to apply to, all my recommenders say they gave strong recommendations (which I am starting to believe now).

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:

Applying to Where: (CMP-E = "Condensed Matter Physics - Experiment", SCMP-E = "Soft Condensed Matter Physics - Experimental")

Reach:
Harvard - Physics - CMP-E (Feb. 25: Rejected for Ph.D via E-mail/Website) (Well, I was expecting that as I realized that I did not get interviewed. It is quite dejecting, though.)
Massachusetts Institute of Technology - Physics - CMP-E (Feb. 12: Rejected for Ph.D via E-mail, Jan 12: Interviewed by a CMP-E Professor) (Well, I guess they at least got to know me before they rejected me. It was saddening, though.)
University of Chicago - Physics - SCMP-E (Feb. 7: Accepted for Ph.D via website + ($34k+$5k) Fellowship + RAships in future) (Yay! I am quite elated! :D )
California Institute of Technology - Physics - CMP-E (Feb. 25: Rejected for Ph.D via E-mail) (Part of me expected this as I found that most of my research experience does not align with Caltech's departmental interests)
Princeton University - Mechanical Engineering - Fluid Dynamics/Biophysics, Biomechanics (Jan. 25: Accepted for Ph.D via Website/E-mail/Phone + $29.9k Fellowship + $8k Summer Support, Jan. 3 - Interviewed by a couple faculty members) (I am quite happy with this actually!) (ATTENDING!)

Match: (I guess?)
Cornell University - Physics - CMP-E (Feb. 11: Accepted for Ph.D via website + $29.7k/9 month TAship) (Yay!) (Will maybe Decline Offer)
University of Pennsylvania - Physics - CMP-E (Mar. 19: Rejected for Ph.D via E-mail) (Well, I don't know what happened there. But this does not affect me anymore.)
New York University - Physics - SCMP-E (Mar. 6: Waitlisted for Ph.D via email) (Wow. I am baffled. I wonder why that happened?)

Safety:
Carnegie Mellon University - Physics - CMP-E (Jan. 29: Accepted via email) (Declined Offer)
University of Wisconsin, Madison - Physics - CMP-E (Jan. 25: Accepted via email + $22k/9 month TA) (Declined Offer) (In my opinion, this is an abysmal financial offer; graduate students at my home university receive more than this, even after adjusting for location)

Final Thoughts: I am very happy with positive responses from UChicago and Princeton. I did realize that I may have expected a little more than I actually received. I would have wished to be accepted by MIT and/or Harvard too but I guess either my profile wasn't convincing enough for them or they didn't quite like my research experience in the context of their departmental constraints. That being said, I don't know what I could have done to be a better candidate for some of my other reach school. I am also not sure how much my international student status impacted the university's decision to reject me. This graduate admissions process definitely made me reevaluate a lot of views I held about myself. I now have some experience with "No pain implies no gain but the inverse is not true". In any case, I look forward to visiting the campuses.

(NOTE: I am very well aware that there are many others who have not received offers yet. I am not writing all this to make other people feel differently about their profiles. I am simply offering a reflection of the graduate admissions process in the specific context of my own profile and what thoughts I had when I was applying. I hope this gives some perspective for future graduate school applicants.)

Undergrad Institution: Super small, unranked state school (I am one of 3 senior physics majors)
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): none
GPA in Major: 3.97
Overall GPA: 3.77
Length of Degree: 4 years
Type of Student: Run of the mill white American male with European descent

GRE Scores :
Q: 161
V: 163
W: 4.0
P: Didn't take

I actually wasn't planning on apply to grad school until next year, and I was planning on taking that time off to study for and take the pGRE. My adviser convinced me to just "go for it" anyway and apply to whatever schools don't require the pGRE on my list, which is why there are only two schools I applied to.


Research Experience: Was invited to work for a professor at University of Michigan on experimental biophysics between my Junior and senior year, which culminated into a poster I will present at the BPS conference (it wasn't an REU, I got this because my adviser at my home school knew the Michigan prof really well). Have a first author publication on experimental biophysics at my home school, and I am currently doing some CMT with a totally different prof. I am also working on a computational biophysics project with the prof I wrote the paper with.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Whole bunch of departmental and university specific awards

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Tutoring physics since the beginning of my sophomore year.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: I have a soundcloud filled with crappy musical ideas

Special Bonus Points: All three of my recommendation letters are from professors I completed research projects with. I am certain they are quite strong. I don't consider myself to be the best writer, but when I wrote my statement of purpose, everything just kinda "clicked" and it was probably the best thing I've ever written.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I play jazz guitar and a UIUC professor who I reference in my statement of purpose ALSO plays guitar

Applying to Where (all for CMT and biophysics theory):

University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) - (Feb. 3: ACCEPTED for Ph.D via email + $23k 11 month TA, Fellowships will be announced later according to the email) - Will probably accept
University of Michigan Ann Arbor - Haven't heard back yet



Decided to throw this up there to give hope to anyone who thinks their app might be lacking. The acceptance to UIUC came as a complete shock to me, since I didn't take the pGRE. Just goes to show how important the rest of the application package is. I lucked out INCREDIBLY hard with this

Undergrad Institution: Big state school in the US, medium reputation in physics & astronomy, top-10 public university
Major(s): Astrophysics
Minor(s):
GPA in Major: 3.77
Overall GPA: 3.79
Length of Degree: 3.5 years
Position in Class: Near-ish top? hard to say!
Type of Student: Domestic white female

GRE Scores :
Q: 164 (86%)
V: 164 (94%)
W: 5.5 (98%)
P: Didn't take!

Research Experience:
Freshman-Sophomore year - 2 semesters of part-time research with a graduate student who showed me the ropes of Linux commands & Python, plus basic observational astronomy topics not yet covered in coursework
Junior year - 1 semester of research done for-credit (ie, on my transcript, and got an A) in observation simulation, more theoretical than previous gig
Summer before senior year - 1 semester of full-time research at an internship with a well-known observatory, again in observation simulation - 1st-author publication still in prep for this
After graduation (which was Dec 2017) - Researching 30 hrs/wk in fully theoretical work with galaxy mergers, another 1st-author publication in prep.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: 1 statewide academic scholarship, 1 major-specific academic scholarship, Dean's list, a few awards for extracurricular activities.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs:
- Student-Athlete astronomy tutor for 1 year
- General math and physics tutor for 1 year
- President of the school's Astronomy Society for 2+ years
- Lots of outreach involvement with the department, one letter of rec definitely mentioned this

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: The code I developed in my internship actually seems to be pretty helpful for a myriad of research interests so if they actually check out the links on my CV, that could help?

Special Bonus Points: Recommenders all insisted their letters would be strong, they all have great connections to the places I'm applying (including being on the admissions committees for a couple of the schools). I'm also a woman, so there's that.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I had to work a service job that was 20+ hours a week throughout my entire undergraduate career, in addition to all my classes, tutoring side gigs, and research endeavors. This kept me from diving as deep into research as I would have liked until I graduated, but it also showed grit, because I did whatever it took to pay the bills, support myself, and still do well in school. I was also really involved in unrelated extracurricular activities largely relating to civic engagement and voter turnout. These efforts were actually pretty darn effective and successful and I'm really proud of that, but I have no idea if the schools care about that one bit. My assumption is, not much.

Applying to Where:

Harvard - Astronomy - Feb 12 Rejected via email to check notification status.
UT Austin - Astronomy - Feb 13 Rejected via email.
University of Florida - Astronomy - Feb 19 Unofficially ACCEPTED via phone call - March 11 Officially accepted via email! Minimum $18,000/9 months for TAship.
UC Santa Cruz - Astronomy - Feb 28 Rejected via email.
UC Santa Barbara - Physics (Astro Emphasis) - March 6 Waitlisted via email from faculty; April 8 Interview; April 10 2nd Interview; April 11 ACCEPTED via email! $10,636/9 months for 10-hr/wk TAship; $10,636 Fithian Fellowship, $2272 Academic Fellowship, $2000 Dean's Fellowship, guaranteed $8456 summer funding, totaling ~$34,000/12 months; could go up with research assistantships. WILL ATTEND!
Northwestern - Astronomy - March 19 Waitlisted via email from faculty
Vanderbilt - Astronomy - April 13 Rejected via email to check website Rumor has it they didn't accept anyone this year??

NSF GRFP - April 9 Awarded Honorable Mention! I'll take that as great news since I can still apply in my first year of grad school!

Bonus notes: I was able to get complete fee waivers for 5 of the above 7 schools, and the other ones were able to make an option for me where I didn't have to pay up-front and would only have to pay later, if accepted, so that was neat. I also pretty stubbornly refused to take the Physics GRE, so I only applied to schools that didn't require it. We'll see how much that affects things!

Research Experience:
Did a research project for one semester freshman year at my school's observatory through a class. I collected and analyzed photometric data of a variable star binary system.

Worked for about a year and a half in a superconducting qubit lab. Was involved with lots of different parts of the experiments. Data analysis with MATLAB, fabrication of qubit devices (including SEM lithography, double-angle evaporation, working with chemicals in a clean room), basic circuitry, Used CAD to design devices for measurement and other tests, and more. Perhaps the most impressive part of my application is that I came up with a new way for controlling our qubit systems and I was able to implement it.

Summer SULI appointment at General Atomics. I worked with a particle simulation code and applied it to create a tool for personnel in the tokamak control room who can use it to quickly identify heating sources. I also did several studies to optimize the code for this use. This involved me learning lots of new programming skills. I also presented my work at APS-DPP.

Undergrad Institution: State school, ranked in lower third of U.S. physics top 100.
Major(s): Astrophysics; Pure Math double-major.
Minor(s): None.
GPA in Major: Physics 3.78; Math 4.05
Overall GPA: 3.91
Length of Degree: Uhhhh, 5? But see below for extra info.
Position in Class: Near top - small class so hard to say, those of us doing well had strengths in different areas.
Type of Student: Domestic white female, graduating this semester.

GRE Scores :
Q: 164 (86%)
V: 166 (97%)
W: 5.5 (98%)
P: 740 (57%)

Research Experience:
- One year of proofy math research (but topic does relate to physics) culminating in successful formal defense of honors thesis in that department;
- Eight months as "undergraduate physicist" for university-associated company that works with space industry;
- One physics REU at a significantly higher-ranked institution;
- Two semesters of research methods credit in QM (emphasis on topics crucial to QFT), cosmology. Mostly supervised learning, no publications.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions:
- Phi Beta Kappa;
- Summa Cum Laude Mathematics Departmental Honors and Outstanding Undergraduate Student Award;
- Sigma Pi Sigma, Phi Kappa Phi, and a couple departmental and university merit-based scholarships awarded in middle of degree.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs:
- Three semesters of employment as math, physics, astronomy tutor by university;
- Three semesters (ongoing) as TA in physics and chemistry (covered 4 different courses, two of them junior-level, 7 lecture sections total);
- All research listed above was paid/funded except the last;

- Once upon a time, before I fell mysteriously ill and had a gap in education, I graduated high school with about 95 credits earned (including 30 in math) from a different state university.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:
-I have a strong interest and track record in teaching (including both paid and volunteer work) and emphasized this in addition to primary research interests, particularly at those schools where Physics Education Research is a thing;
-Worst couple grades on current transcript explained fairly well by outside circumstances.



Applying to Where:
All for whichever areas of HEP, Gravity and/or Cosmology each school is strong in (strong emphasis on theory, with a slight possible willingness to bend towards experimental/observational depending on the exact topic and mentor). Applied for physics (not astro). I know that HEP-TH is highly competitive and there will be plenty of applicants from more well-known schools and with higher personal stats, so hopefully this long list with some spread will work out for me! Listed in order of overall department rankings, not necessarily in order of preference.

Harvard - Gee, sure is taking them a long time to reject me! :P
Cornell - Feb. 19: REJECTED
U Michigan - Feb. 14 contact confirmed I will be rejected and unusually small number of HEP-TH offers made this year Feb. 15: REJECTED
U Maryland - Feb. 14: Rejected.
U Penn -
U Wash -
UT Austin -
Penn State - Feb. 21 ACCEPTED - $22k Fall/Spring TA + $4000 Academic Year Fellowship + $4000 Summer Fellowship Support = $30,000 for first year. Pretty excited about this one! I had started to give up hope with how late in the month it is and here they come WITH fellowship money! :D
U Minnesota - Jan. 14: ACCEPTED - approximately $26.5K total TA and summer support, told that number may increase slightly. :D
UC Davis -
Brown University -
North Carolina Chapel Hill - applied a couple days past "priority" deadline

Applying to Where:
All computational astrophysics
ACCEPTED REJECTED WAITLIST
School - UIUC (Feb 21 Rejected via email)
School - Vanderbilt
School - Georgia tech (Feb 12: WAITLIST <- will probably leave waitlist soon)
School - Notre Dame (Apr 5 Rejected via email to check website)
School - Iowa (Feb 11: ACCEPTED for Ph.D via email)
School - Oklahoma
School - Tennessee, Knoxville (Mar 5: ACCEPTED for Ph.D via email)
School - Alabama

No response from the rest of the schools as of Apr 11. I am assuming rejection.

I just wanted to show what a more 'normal' application might look like. The schools I chose were influence heavily by location. From what my professors have told me, the applicants here are incredible on average (seriously the people here rock!) In my opinion, the biggest deciding factor is letters of rec, which I knew that at least one of my letters was fantastic. My advice to everyone who is panically reading these like I did for 3.5 years is to work on getting good solid research with a professor who you can relate to personally as well. Also, don't procrastinate on your statement of purpose and write it on new years eve like I did.

Undergrad Institution: Reputed Indian Institute
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): NA
GPA : 8.978/10
Length of Degree: B.Sc. Physics ( hons) 3 years + M.Sc.Physics (2 years) [5 Years]
Position in Class: Near top
Type of Student:International male

GRE Scores : (only took once)
Q: 156
V: 152
W: 3.0
P: 680



IELTS: 8


Research Experience:
First internship in accelerator Physics ( 1 month )
Master's thesis work in US at UIC in Solar cells ( 4 months) with one submitted paper.
Currently interning in Physics Education Research at HBCSE, India. ( Since Jan 21)


Awards/Honors/Recognitions:
Academically : Scholarships in school and silver medalist in college.
Extra: Also a few in cultural activities, sports and leadership roles.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs:
2 Years of work experience in AIESEC student leadership organization and 5 months of part-time teaching (Physics) experience during my Master's degree.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: I care about what I am going to do and see how it will make this world a better place.

Special Bonus Points: Recommendations are from where I did my research work. Quite passionate about Physics Education Research. Took some relevant courses in Psychology, Data analysis and Reasearch methodology during undergrad.



Applying to Where: USA (4) and Canada (1)

PhD In Physics Education Research (PER):

Cornell - Physics - PER : Rejection ( Feb 19) : Not Accepted (Feb 19).
UIUC - Physics - PER Not Accepted (8 March).
Purdue - Physics - PER : Not Expecting *
University of Colorado Boulder - Physics- PER : Not Accepted (Feb 18).

Phd in CMP:

[u] University of British Columbia - Physics - CMP : Not Accepted (Feb 21).

Best thing about my application is that my career goals aligns very well with my intention to work in PER. I wish I had discovered this field of research before but better late than never.

Lastly, I know my application might look slightly ambitious considering my GRE scores. But I know I have it in me and a speed testing standardized test won't stop the committee from seeing it. My PhD work will define my youth, so better to do it from a place I love or do something else.

Post Rejection Thoughts:

I think the world cares less about my intentions and more about how I can do on exams to test speed (ETS). All the extra work, my teaching and leadership experiences seems to play no role. I guess I was in illusion about either my own profile or the American Education. It feels bad today, I really wanted to make a difference. I guess my plan for the PhD is going to come crashing soon and I must look for other ways to serve this world.

Some thoughts:
Glad to give back to this forum after looking at it and stressing for two years :D
I had been feeling terribly pessimistic about my applications for the past month but got surprised this week with my first acceptance, and it is from one of my top choice schools which I genuinely can't believe. My advice is, don't sell yourself short! Recommendation letters and research experience can go a long way! Most of the people who post in this kind of forum are bound to be outstanding individuals so don't let that discourage you. Apply to a reasonable number of schools, covering from your top tier dream school to a reasonably safe choice, try to get your lab advisor's input on what programs to apply to.

Undergrad Institution: Well-known state school
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): None
GPA in Major: 4.00/4.00
Overall GPA: 4.00/4.00
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: We don't rank, but probably top
Type of Student: Domestic female

GRE Scores :
Q: 170
V: 164
W: 5.5
P: 940

Research Experience: Two summers at top 10 schools and one summer at home institution, all in astrophysics/cosmology. One in-prep paper that I think my recommender mentioned in the letter. I got really lucky one summer and landed a very well-connected and famous group that definitely helped a lot with apps--one recommender actually mentioned to me during our interview "I was just talking to [my recommender] over the weekend!"

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Goldwater scholar (hot take: I think this is heavily overrated; whether you get it depends so much on the school you go to), GPA-related awards from my school, REU award for best poster.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Heavily involved with women in physics organization at my school. TA'd a few intro physics and stats classes

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Nope!

Special Bonus Points: One recommender who I worked for one summer is very famous, but I actually doubt it was my strongest letter (although I'm sure it helped that he's super well-connected). Another recommender I took a class and then did research with for a year; he knew me really well and I'm sure that was my strongest. But all three recommenders were just so, so kind and helpful throughout the entire process. Feeling incredibly grateful.

GRE Scores : Revised
Q: 170
V: 152
W: 4.0
P: 790 (66%)


TOEFL: Waived since I got a U.S. bachelor's degree.


Research Experience:
---- 2 years research assistant at a national accelerator facility. Including 1 year full time research work after graduation (still on going). No paper or poster.
---- 1 year fundamental physics research. Focused on the searching of EDM (still on going). No paper or poster.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: None

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: None

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Some volunteer work?

Special Bonus Points: 2 out of 3 recommenders know me well. One is my research advisor who gives me a very strong letter. The other one is my two upper level courses professor, who was impressed by how much I improved during those two classes. Assuming it's also a decent letter. Third one comes from a math professor. I did well on that upper level class and went to a lot of office hours. Wouldn't be as strong as the other two letter though.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I did horrible during my second year. Explained that a little bit in my statement. Last two years I'd say it's average/above. Since I knew there was little hope to get anywhere last year because of my poor GPA, I decided to take a gap year and continue doing full time research and self studying. I'm sure this experience helped a lot in my application this year. Also mentioned about attending one upcoming national conference in my statement.

Applying to Where:

Colorado State U - Physics - Nuc Exp
Indiana University Bloomington - Physics - Nuc Exp
North Carolina State U - Physics - Nuc Exp (Rejected via email check website 01/20ish
Michigan State U - Physics - Nuc Exp

U of Arizona - Physics - AMO
U of Rochester - Physics - AMO (Rejected via email check on website 03/06)
Wayne State U - Physics - Particle Exp (Accepted via email on 02/27) Declined on 03/08
Illinois Institute of Technology - Physics - Nuc Exp (Accepted via email on 03/01 via department) Declined on 03/24

Post Submission Thoughts:
My profile is definitely not as strong as the others on this forum. Poor GPA and pGRE. No awards or extra activities. For those of you who have similar profile, don't let your 'not great' profiles discourage you from applying to grad schools. You never know where you would get to unless you apply. Worst case is one rejection letter but if you don't apply, there is no chance to be accepted at all. Cheers!

Im pretty stoked about ETH. After getting the masters, I'll go right for the Ph.D. Idk why I didnt apply for ESOP. Shouldve applied since there was nothing to lose. Boulder was my top choice and I had been in contact with a professor there, so pretty bummed about that, but ETH was my second choice so alls good.

Good luck to everyone else during this stressful time! Dont forget to breath!

Post-application reflection and extra info (very long):

I certainly overestimated my qualifications, but no harm trying, right? Here are a few more details that are hopefully useful for future applicants.

Recommendation letters. All strong letters, probably the strongest one from a young physics prof who seems to be a rising star in the field. The other 2 recommenders are not known in physics. My recommendation letters might be one of the decisive factors to failure? Nobody will ever know anyway.

GRE and TOEFL. Certainly can be better; but it sure is costly. Having spent so much on applications, and being a penniless fresh graduate, this can be really crippling. So much inertia to retake these exams. Suggestion: I know a few people who stick around as project officers/ research assistants. This is probably the best choice: you can earn some money first (pay your loan etc) and get some RELEVANT publications (more on this later, I advocate committing yourself to a research topic and group). One of them got into Cornell (but not most other schools) with about 5 publications within 3 years working.

Research experience
My first research in an applied physics lab was utterly disappointing. The prof assigned me to a graduating PhD student who probably could not be bothered. He made me read textbook for the summer, and soon he graduated without leaving me so much as an inch of laboratory experience. Completely disillusioned, I left the lab. Afterwards, I was hopping about from one research to another. I was looking for a "good research group" and prepared myself with lots of computer programming. Do I find a "good" research group? On the hindsight it depends on myself; I must be too idealistic. So, I will say I did not. Why computer programming? Being rather disappointed in doing physics, I was simply preparing for future employment bearing in mind there is not much future for me in physics along the direction I envision. Doing computer programming, is that a good choice? Yes and no. No, because, I could have instead stuck to a physics research and commit my full attention to it, but this is hypothesis contrary to fact- pretty much meaningless. Yes, because at the very least I get the compromise choice I prepared for... well... Anyway, I learnt machine learning stuffs, contributed quite significantly to the company I did internship in (employed there later, before moving to my current job) and included them in my application; this point does not seem to help much in application.

On the hind-sight, I think it is important to join a research group early, stay committed to it and be highly adaptable. **Biased personal opinion ahead, stop reading if you are easily offended**: If things start to get rough and you start to think you do not like that research topic, then reflect on yourself, reflect on what you did wrong and stay there a little longer (in my case, I should then realise I was such a trash and I should do better). This is especially the case if the research group is at least somewhat renowned; you might not want to miss the chance to work there again just because of immaturity at the moment. This should apply in most cases other than research.

Application
The way I applied to these schools is quite simple. For each school, I checked the faculty list and indicated interests in faculties that are most reputable. My statement of purpose was mostly general, emphasized my versatility (I do not have a specialization) and appealed to myself being a somewhat minority w.r.t. US demographic (not sure about this). As you can see, my application is disastrous. The graduate admission may just think I am some undecided brat trying my luck and I cannot fully deny that.

That concludes my attempt at getting into a well-known Physics graduate school. It was expensive. Physics GRE only lasts for 2 years (unfortunately this is the second year for me) and too much of a hassle to relearn and retake. It is quite clear that the admission process is not fully merit-based anyway, plus with dying passion, given 3 more chances to apply I am more than 98% sure it will just fail again. At least 4 years of undergrad physics was fun while it lasted. Regrets? No regrets, if i have time to regret I should spend time planning for the next step and scheming to get the next better opportunity. I guess that's good bye physics.

Research Experience:
All at my school.
2nd Year Summer Lab Intern (12 weeks): Laser cooling and molecule trapping; mostly hands-on lab work building a novel kind of molecular beam decelerator for feeding into the trap; learned plenty of practical stuff like vacuum kits, lasers, cleaning and 3D modelling; overall enjoyable but of course no publication or anything since it's pure manual work.
3rd Year Summer Lab Intern (10 weeks): Pulsed-Power Plasma experiments; again lab works only; very fun to learn about all the stuff like Marx banks and laser diagnostics and all the other tailor-made experimental set up, really cool lab; again no publication or anything tho.
Master Thesis Project (about 6 months but not full time): Perovskite material for solar cell applications; bit too much chemistry and not enough physics for my liking; limited scope; potential publication as results may be incorporated into a PhD student's work.

Some Thoughts:
Haven't seen many posts that show similar experience to mine so I thought I would write a few words.
First of all it's not easy to assemble a decent application from a UK undergraduate degree, mainly due to lack of proper research experience. The system supports summer research but anything long term like REU in US is not encouraged. There are more physics modules and lectures instead. As a result, good recommendation letters are hard to come by. Also, publications are extremely rare among my peers. Those with publications have to show exceptional initiatives I think.
Masters in UK are one year only, so that constrains the time frame quite a bit compared to longer master degrees from say Europe or China.
Based on the results which are half expected, I would say just liking physics throughout undergrad degree and research is hardly enough. An early on commitment seems crucial. I am not a physics nerd since young, but rather grew to like physics gradually while keeping a wide range of interests. In hindsight this definitely makes the path to postgrad physics difficult, but I don't really regret it. That's just how I evolve as a person. So I would say don't get discouraged if you are like me.
I don't think GRE scores matter much as I have friends with perfect PGre scores and excellent course grades that got rejected by all.
Finally I will just mention that being a Chinese national these days may have made it a tiny bit more difficult? Like I am having VISA troubles even with offer letters. As a result I am deferring till next year just in case. I heard horror stories of how Chinese PhD students got stuck half way through their degrees when their VISA renewal application got reviewed and took couple months to more than a year. Hope someone can tell me how bad it really is currently.

Semi-victory post. Heard back from the biggest schools now, so I don't feel like I'll jinx myself. :)

Undergrad Institution: Big State, Top 20 in Physics/Astro
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): Lots of classes in Geology 8)
GPA in Major: 2.9ish last two years
Overall GPA: 3.2
Length of Degree: 5
Position in Class: Struggled
Type of Student: DWF, older now that I've taken a break

GRE Scores :
Q: 155
V: 161
W: 4
P: 490 :shock: :lol: Probably could've retaken and jumped into 600's, but $$$ and I also didn't apply to all programs that required the PGRE.


Research Experience:
1.5 last years at school on linear device with spectroscopy. No pubs. Presented poster and got highest undergraduate research honor.

Summer REU building circuit for radar sensing system. Very rewarding, highly recommend (at KU). One co-author.

2 years at national lab (out of 4 I've taken off). First internship on semi-HEDP (plasma jets, woot woot). Second on a nuclear diagnostic for ICF implosions. One co-author; one potential co-author in manuscript. Presented poster at APS which was well-received. Gave a talk on the research, too.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Prize mentioned above. REU.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Hung out with the astro and SPS kids a lot, and was an officer for my last two years with Women in Physical Sciences. Started first-ever Physical Sciences Poster Fair at our school (the normal one is dominated by biologists and some engineers). Proudest moment was when I helped raise on the order of 10k's in $ to win a proposal to hold CUWiP at our school. :D

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Mostly focused on research and science-related activities in my application. Practically had a minor in music, but didn't think they'd care especially given my GPA.

Special Bonus Points: Two well-known recommenders in my field. One strong LOR from current advisor. Couldn't be more grateful.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Worked at a restaurant for two years while not in school. I'm an older student.

Applying to Where:


Reach:

Wisconsin, Madison - Physics - Plasma: Basic and fusion (Jan. 30: Rejected via website; March 1: Rejected via email)
UCSD - Mech and Aero Engineering - Plasma: Z pinches (Feb. 8: ACCEPTED for Ph.D via email + $29k/yr RA)

UNM - Physics - Plasma: Basic and pulsed power/pinches (Feb. 13: Rejected via website)
U of Michigan - Applied Physics - Plasma: LPI re- loads of stuff (March 13: Rejected via email) Was worth a shot!
U of Rochester - Physics - Plasma: ICF and all the HEDP laser things (March 14: Rejected via email to check website) Ah well, looks like I was in the running for a bit at least. :)

Because I had an infatuation with electrical and computer engineering:
Boston University - ECE - Optics and information theory (Jan. 24: Rejected via email)
Wisconsin, Madison - ECE - Optics and information theory
U of Maryland - ECE - Optics and information theory

Fallback*:
UNM - ECE - Plasma: Basic and pulsed power/pinches (March 6: Unofficially accepted for Ph.D via email + $20k/yr RA)

*Honestly wasn't even sure I'd get in ANYWHERE, not even my "fallback."

Some Thoughts 4/3/2019:

For those of you waiting for response, heres some more speculation to fuel your anxiety. It seems to be a statisically significant trend that schools tend to send admission responses on the first day of the month.

For those of you thinking about applying to a PhD Program. Before you even apply to a school, EMAIL PROFESSORS in the reseach area you are interested in and ask if they has space and funding for new graduate students to work with them. I wish I had done this. Not only will this demonstrate your interest in the program and build a connection with potential advisors early; it will also save you time. I realized after I applied to MSU that all the positions for solar physics research were filled and the professors had no need for new students.
