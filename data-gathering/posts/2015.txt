Undergrad Institution: Large State school, Ranked ~50 in physics
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): Mathematics
GPA in Major: 4.00
Overall GPA: 4.00
Length of Degree: 4
Position in Class: At the top (kinda have to be...)
Type of Student: Domestic White Male, socioeconomically advantaged

GRE Scores (revised, Updated in November):
Q: 170 (98%)
V: 166 (96%)
W: 5 (93%)
P: 990 (94%)

Research Experience:
- Currently in 3rd year of UG research at my home institution in Condensed matter theory. I had a publication in progress (i.e. being written) at the time of applications with myself as first author, but it didn't get submitted for publication until January after deadlines. I presented my work at 1 conference, one small event.
- REU in experimental condensed matter physics (Cornell), 1 publication with myself as second author, one conference preceedings.
- REU in experimental AMO physics (Michigan), no publications expected, uniquely selected from REU students to present my research at CUR national REU symposium.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: (Within your school or outside?)
- Goldwater Honorable Mention
- Won a competitive departmental essay prize
- Various Honors scholarships
- Various departmental scholarships

Pertinent Activities or Jobs:
- Tutored students from an interdisciplinary science class for a semester.
- On the leadership team founding an interdisciplinary undergraduate research club.

Special Bonus Points: (Such as connections, grad classes, famous recommenders, female or minority status etc...)
- Taking 2 grad physics classes now, will take 3 in spring
- I'm lucky enough to be able to solicit 4 letters, 1 from UGR at home institution, one from each REU, another from professor I've taken ~4 small classes with, and done a study abroad with.
- I take a lot of credits, Almost double the average some semesters, despite having only 1 major & 1 minor.
- Took a non-standard interdisciplinary introductory science sequence, instead of the normal "fundamentals of physics" class-type. Also did some other non-physics stuff, like organic chemistry & a nanoscience study abroad (only 2 weeks long).

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:
- I'm not really committed to any field of physics yet, or even experimental Vs. theoretical, I just like all of physics too much :roll:. Leaning toward experimental AMO. Hope this doesn't count against me. :?
- I've played trumpet in at least one music ensemble every semester of undergrad.

Applying to Where:

All regular physics programs, all AMO physics as my primary interest

Stanford: ACCEPTED! 2/12.
MIT: REJECTED. 2/18.
Harvard: REJECTED. 3/2.
Cal-Tech: ACCEPTED! 2/12.
Berkeley: ACCEPTED! 2/25.
Chicago: ACCEPTED! 1/30.
Cornell: ACCEPTED! 2/10.
U Michigan: ACCEPTED! 1/14.
Yale: ACCEPTED! 2/26.
UC Boulder: ACCEPTED! 1/29.
U Maryland: ACCEPTED! 2/10.

NSF Fellowship: REJECTED, 4/1. E/VG, VG/VG, F/P. I think that the wide disparity of the score here is something of a testament to how much of a shot in the dark these things can be. That last guy must just not have had his morning coffee.
NDSEG Fellowship: REJECTED, 4/1.
Hertz Fellowship: REJECTED, 1st round

Reflections: I obviously have nothing to complain about, but in all honesty I was somewhat surprised to not get into Harvard or MIT. I have several theories as to why this happened, but the most probable was that my letters weren't as good as they could have been. In particular, my first REU at Cornell was my first exposure to experimental physics at all, and I probably wasn't particularly impressive a student throughout the summer. If you try something like that, make sure you know what you are doing going in so that you can be as productive as possible. Evidently, if you are coming from a sub-top-20 undergraduate institution, you really, really need every advantage to get into these places. I am also suspicious, particularly with MIT, that the schools were turned off by my lack of firm commitment to AMO physics. They might prefer that students know exactly what they want to do. I'm only speculating of course. Anyway, I'm quite happy with my many offers. Good luck to future applicants!

It seems like the app process is finally over. Mine was kinda weird. Got into my safety, my top, and one dead center. I hope that this shows other people with low GPA's or GRE's that there's still places out there for you, just don't go shooting for those upper tier schools (I'm lookin' at you, Brown and Duke). Hopefully I will be able to update soon what I decide to do.
Ended up picking PSUD. If anyone else has international aspirations, at least know that europe "can" be more accomodating, depending on your skill set.

Undergrad Institution: UCLA
Major(s): Chemistry
GPA in Major: 3.56
Overall GPA: 3.62 (3.75 upper division)
Length of Degree: 4 years, transfer student
Position in Class: Above average (just shy of cum laude)
Type of Student: Domestic White Male (first generation and transfer student)

GRE Scores :
Q: 164 (88%)
V: 160 (84%)
W: 4.5 (80%)
P: 910 (86%)

Research Experience: Over a year in a geochemistry lab including employment as a lab assistant after graduation. One semester of upper division research which ended in a poster presentation.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: N/A

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: I've had a web design hobby since middle school so have a pretty solid coding background. I also run a small science website (http://onlinesciencetools.com) that I started as a sophomore. As mentioned, I worked in a lab assistant for a brief period of time in the lab I was a part of during undergrad. I also read a lot outside of school and have a math background significantly stronger than my transcripts represent (of course, I'm not sure how much that will count for since I only have my word to show for it).

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: My grades improved significantly my second (senior) year at UCLA with almost all As and A+s in math, physics, and physical chemistry.

Special Bonus Points: All of my letters should be pretty strong and I believe my statements of purposes are pretty solid. Although I left my interests somewhat broad (most areas related to quantum computing interest me), they were also fairly detailed and focused and well tailored to each school.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Although I majored in chemistry, I've taken a handful of upper division physics courses and have taken all the core physics (quantum, classical mechanics, E&M, and thermo), although nothing advanced like plasma or nuclear.

Thank you to the OP for providing a template to vomit all my anxieties out on
______________________________________________
Undergrad Institution: Big State School, not well-known for physics - ranked 60ish on U.S. News (if that is an accurate metric for ranking schools in the first place...)
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): Astronomy, Math
GPA in Major: 3.91
Overall GPA: 3.93
Length of Degree: 3 years
Position in Class: No. 2 (out of 60-ish) :evil:
Type of Student: Domestic Asian male (interesting how little domestic Asians there are that post here...)

GRE Scores :
(revised)
Q: 166
V: 152 (...eh)
W: TBD
P: 910 (86%)

Research Experience: A year of HEP research on analyzing and constructing calibration equations from beam data obtained at QWeak. Another year of CME research on micromechanical exfoliation properties of metal dichalcogenides and the characterization of such materials through optical microscopy and STM. Expected paper by next semester which I will most likely be the first author.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Scholarships within the physics department and Honors (which probably has no bearing whatsoever in the application process...)

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: None really. I tutor my friends in freshman physics often, but I don't do it for pay or anything to consider it a part-time job or "pertinent activity."

Special Bonus Points: Currently taking a graduate mathematical methods course and will be taking graduate courses in solid state physics (second semester; first semester is an undergrad/grad course) and quantum mechanics. Also taking math classes in complex analysis for fun and engineering courses in semiconductor devices.

I don't know if this is a bonus point at all, but I'm on a track to graduate in three years. I guess it isn't bad to take graduate courses in your third year of undergrad, no? At the same time though, I basically lost a summer of applying to an REU and one whole year of research at my university :/ Mixed bag, I guess.

Although I'm a minority, I have no idea how many "domestic Asian male" applicants apply and what the general statistic is for scores and such for that particular pool. So I have minority status, but once again, I have no idea how I stand up to other domestic Asians or even international Asians if all odds are against me.

Lastly, one of my letter writers (whom is also the professor teaching the solid state physics course) did his post-doc at Berkeley, so he has a ton of connections to the Condensed Matter Experimental folks there. Luckily, Berkeley happens to be my top choice :D
My other letter writers will be the professor I did HEP-Ex research for and another professor who I've had for all my courses and labs in for astrophysics.

Applying to Where:

I'm applying to CME, sooooo yeah. No need to regurgitate CME for 15 schools.

The Works:

UC Berkeley
Harvard
MIT
Stanford
Princeton
Columbia
Cornell
U. Ill. Urbana-Champaign - Accepted 1/25 - $22.2k/11 months TA
UC Santa Barbara

Low Priority

U. Michigan - Ann Arbor
U. Washington - Accepted 1/14 - $1956/mo. TA + 5k scholarship

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Learned calculus when I was in 8th grade. Have been doing college-level Physics for almost 10 years now in various contexts.

Applying to Where: All HEP-ex with a secondary interest in CME.

Princeton - Rejected 2/19
Harvard - Rejected 3/2
Stanford - Rejected 2/17
Yale - Rejected 2/16
Columbia - Rejected 3/27
UMD - Rejected 2/16
UCBoulder - Accepted 3/2 - $17.3k/9 months TA + $1k initial "signing bonus"
UIUC - Accepted 1/30 - $22.2k/11 months TA
UW Seattle - Accepted 2/11 - $21.6k/11 months TA + $2.5k initial "signing bonus" DECLINED

Notes & observations: Grades and test scores are not everything. This is not undergrad anymore, where you have to show the committee that you are a well-rounded individual with a balanced set of skills. Grad school is really the time of your life when you become the best at a VERY SPECIFIC skillset. The top schools will gladly admit people with a ton of research experience and some publications (not necessary, but usually a deciding factor when judging two similar applicants), although some of them have not seen the sunlight in 4 years! I was expecting more positive responses from the elite schools I applied to, not in small part due to my stellar undergraduate record. However, looking back, I should have spent more time trying to do research, if not during the school year, then at least during the summer. Moreover, I am not sure if my letters of recommendation were very strong, a concern I expressed as early as I made an account here. So, to conclude (from importance of item to the overall application):

- get good grades in your upper-division Physics courses (especially important if you studied Physics at a renowned university)
- Physics GRE. You should absolutely study for this exam. A month should be enough, but some people might find that is not enough. Grab "Conquering the Physics GRE", easily the best resource on the market.
- Have meaningful research experience. I cannot stress this enough. While having publications helps, it is not necessary. On the other hand, you need to show that you have learned techniques which are translatable to graduate school. Drilling holes and melting tubes doesn't count...
- Letters of rec, General GRE (don't be an analphabet! :mrgreen: ), overall GPA, personal statement. Don't ever lie!

UMaryland - Astronomy - waitlisted 2/3 - interview 3/11 - rejected 4/14


Reflection: If you want to do planetary science, PGRE doesn't matter, as many schools don't even ask for it. It seems my strong letters of recommendation, GPA, GRE, and laboratory research went a long way to getting me accepted, even though I have no publications. My statements were mostly talking about my time in labs and computer experience, in addition to mentioning professors at the school I was applying to as people who researched topics similar to my interests. Many professors at (accepted) schools I visited commented that they loved my computer programming experience, so I'd recommend prospective grads start learning Python and C++. I think my record shows that you can be an upper tier student with almost no professional output yet and still get in if you apply to enough schools.

I found these profiles to be extremely helpful throughout my school selection process, I think this is a great resource for people, so here we go:

Undergrad Institution: Tiny liberal arts school, no reputation for physics
Major(s): Physics-Astronomy
Minor(s):
GPA in Major: 3.93
Overall GPA: 3.91
Length of Degree: 4
Position in Class: Near top, not sure
Type of Student: Domestic white male

GRE Scores : revised
Q: 162 (83%)
V: 165 (95%)
W: 4.5 (80%)
P: Fall of Junior year: 840 (77%), Fall of Senior year: 890 (84%)

Research Experience:
One year doing optics research on the thermo-optic properties of LIGO coatings with a professor at my home institution.
One summer REU with a well known prof. in the field of computational astrophysics/cosmology, went very well, resulted in my being a co-author on a paper currently being submitted to a high-profile journal
This year I've been working with a prof. at my home institution on some computational work involving the direct detection of dark matter, may result in a thesis next semester.


Awards/Honors/Recognitions: "Academic Distinction" every year, don't think that really means anything

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Been tutoring physics, asto, and calc for 3 years, TA-ing astro labs for 2 years, and I also helped a prof. develop and run a course designed to introduce physics students to computational modeling.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

Special Bonus Points: one of my recommenders knows people at many of the places I'm applying and has dropped my name around a couple of the dpt.'s. Also went to the AAS and talked with people on admissions committees at several of the institutions I've applied to. Edit: I think this was a huge factor in my application, definitely go to conferences and schmooze if you can.

Applying to Where: For physics, All for CME/CMT...interest in HEP-th might have been obvious from research experience+I talked about problems I am interested in

Purdue University - Jan 22

Ohio State University- Jan 23
University of California Los Angeles - Feb 27 Rejected via email. Oh well =)

UIUC - Late March

USC - May (snail mail, I don't know the exact date because I went on vacation)

Penn State - mid March

*I had other application acceptances, but they were not for physics and some were job applications. The choice was very hard to make between grad school and job, but that's life. Decisions are tough. I hope future applicants will also have a variety of options to choose from, but in the end you can only pick one.*



Disregard this advice if you want to do experiment (below)

If I could have done things differently, I would have signed up for September AND October test. Physics gre scores matter a lot for theory. If you lurked around this forum, you already know that. However, how much it matters depends on the school you went to. From my experience, it matters a lot if you didn't go to a topish school for undergrad (in physics). I would have given myself more options if I had a higher pgre score. Obviously grades matter too and they matter the most (compared to pgre), but they look at trends, level of the class etc.

I don't want to claim being a bad test taker, because I tend to do well on exams that do not have a time pressure on them. Depending on the subject and my comfort in the material, I would do well even with time pressure. For whatever reason, I effed up on the physics gre. On practice exams I was doing much much better. Soo much better that I was confident going into the exam.... sucks SO my advice is to do GREAT on the practice test so you will do GOOD on the real thing. Don't aim for GOOD on practice test or otherwise the real one might just be okay ( like me).

Also don't lose confidence in physics if you have a sucky physics gre score (unless if you don't know your physics). I was well prepared for the content of the exam, but who knows maybe something equivalent to stage fright crept in.

Publications are a great thing to have if you gpa/pgre are sort of on the mediocre range... Because research experience/recommendation letters matter the most in the end. very strong recommendation letters are a must! So form a good relationship with your research mentors and work hard!
It's tough to get publications at a small LAC, but even at other schools it depends on the prof and really good timing.


I do not regret applying to the schools I did, in fact, it was a good range in my opinion (if you take into account ALL applications and not just physics). NEVER just aim too high or too low... aim for places you can thrive in and be happy living in. If getting a post doc and being a faculty matters to you then work hard to get into a school that will take you on that path. For the record, most schools do... but it all depends on you.

Research Experience:

Two years on a significant astro instrumentation project funded by a huge NSF grant. Advisor of this project is my primary recommendor, and he will write me a stellar letter. The research itself is highly notable and should look really great on my application. Publication pending in a reputable journal.

I also just recently started some research with another notable Yale professor doing observational stellar astronomy -- the details of which she doesn't really want me to discuss, as we're fighting time on this project. If we're successful, this will provide significant evidence toward a recent theory about a specific Milky Way satellite, and that will lead to another publication on which I will be the second author. This advisor is my second recommendor.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs:

Tutored physics to the youngins' at my school, did generic lab work/repair work for the physics department. Presentations regarding my research for the Physics Club, and I've represented the Physics department at a number of university events.

Other Information:

Major coursework such as E&M, Classical and Quantum came way later in my studies than they should have. Also worked 30+ hours a week (plus research) for most of my college career.

Applying to Where:

None of the schools I'm applying to, aside from Georgia State, will receive my PGRE score.

University of Arizona - Lunar and Planetary Lab - Rejected 2/10

Undergrad Institution: Western Michigan University [actually decent quality physics (both classes and research), but nothing spectacular]

Major: Physics
Minor(s): Astronomy and Mathematics
GPA in Major:4.00
Overall GPA:3.98
Length of Degree: 3.5
Position in Class:Either 1st or 2nd in all physics classes
Type of Student: International male

GRE Scores : Revised
Q: 170 (98%)
V: 162 (89%)
W: 5.0 (93%)
P: 920 (88%) - Oct 2014


Research Experience: Just an independent study for my astronomy minor on active galactic nuclei (AGN) and the iron problem with AGN (spectra indicates too much iron compared to expected amounts from theoretical modelling)

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Scholarship from western michigan university. Dean's list. Honors college member.
So, basically nothing that actually matters.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Graded Physics II: Electricity and Magnetism in Spring '14. Supplemental Instruction (fancy term for tutor) for Fall '14. Grading Introduction to Astrophysics in Spring '15 (side note: Incredibly excited about grading an upper level course).

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Not really.

Special Bonus Points:
1. Had an english professor, who was on my honors thesis committee and is generally very fond of me and also very confident of my abilities to write, write letters for universities that allowed more than 3 recommenders. Could provide no help in swaying admissions committees whatsoever, or could help.
2. having department chair write letters for me (I will be grading for him in Intro to Astro next semester having done very well in it last spring).
3. Also, my letter writers seem to generally know someone at quite a few places i will be applying, however I know this will probably mean little in the context of admissions.
4. Taking Nuclear and Particle Physics (one class) next semester, which is essentially a grad class

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:

Talked about study abroad experience in Italy last summer (2014), which was about art and Renaissance history type stuff within the context of philosophy and science history type frameworks on SOP. Again, might be of no help, or it might help sway admissions committees.

Applying to Where: All schools are Theoretical cosmology type stuff, a.k.a hep theory except chicago which is astrophysics, but with a preference to hep theory physics.

Undergrad Institution: Service Academy
Major(s): Astrophysics
Minor(s): German
GPA in Major: 3.44
Overall GPA: 3.40
Length of Degree: 4
Position in Class: top 25%, sort of irrelevant since it includes military performance and stuff
Type of student: male

GRE Scores : new version
Q: 170 (98%)
V: 158 (78%)
W: 4.5 (56%)
P: 580 (25%)....no time to study with my military commitments, wished I had taken it when I was still in school, not 5 years later without studying. Weakest part of my application

Research Experience: Very limited while undergrad but I tried to have my recommenders highlight it

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: physics honor society, Foreign language honor society, various military awards

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: The biggest thing I'm selling myself on is being qualified by the department of energy as the chief engineer officer for nuclear powered ship

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: I was a division 1 swimmer and also qualified navy diver with spec ops training....not sure if it helps but I'm using it.

Special Bonus Points: Basically the military thing, I've got strong lors from professors and my commanding officer. Trying to sell myself on deployment and leadership experience and also extensive maintenence experience coordinating with government contractors.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I think putting everything in the resume format really helped sell myself. My personal statement is a little long but I really tried to show how my experiences prepared me for grad work in a unique way and that I have a passion for the subject. I'm really banking on schools reading what I wrote because, when evaluated strictly off numbers, I look pretty weak.

Applying to Where: All schools are for astrophysics/astronomy. I'm mostly interested in galactic evolution and low mass bodies, particularly brown dwarfs

Undergrad Institution: Big State School, not sure about rank, but it's solid. Maybe top 50?
Major(s): Astronomy-Physics
Minor(s):
GPA in Major: 3.66
Overall GPA: 3.66 (weird coincidence)
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: Not sure...near lower top probably
Type of Student: Domestic white male

GRE Scores : (revised or old version?)
Q: 170 (98%)
V: 162 (89%)
W: 5.0 (93%)
P: 990 (94%)...shocked on this. averaged around an 800 on practice tests. Strongly recommend using "Conquering the Physics GRE" to study



Research Experience: 2 summers (1 full time, 1 part time), and 2 semesters, for 2 total projects. First was an xray astronomy project that, while valuable, didn't get very far as I lacked computer experience. 2nd project was a much more involved star formation project. Will result in 1 Nth author paper and 1 first author paper (in that order), and I plan on presenting at conferences. No publications/posters at time of application though.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: All at school. Best was a school-wide scholarship I applied for and won. Other than that I was in a Greek Honor Society, got a top 20% of class award, and of course a few Dean's Lists

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Tutor for ESOL kids in math and science for 2 years. TA for 2 semesters. Lab Assistant for 1 summer. Volunteered at a local observatory for ~30 hours 1 summer

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Who knows

Special Bonus Points: Strong letters, a few grad classes (even though I'm pretty sure they don't care about that)

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:

Applying to Where (All Observational Astronomy):

Ohio State: WAITLISTED via email 1/4 - Withdrew application
Caltech: Rejected via email 2/17
Princeton: Rejected via email 2/6
Columbia: Rejected via email to check website 2/26
Yale: Rejected via email to check website 2/23
UT-Austin: Interview request via email 1/20 - Skype Interview 1/23 - Accepted via email 1/29! $30K from TAship and fellowships
U Colorado-Boulder: Rejected via email 2/13
Penn St: Accepted via phone call 1/24 - Received fellowship totaling 33k for first year
U Maryland: Interview request via email 2/13 - Skype Interview 2/16 - Accepted 4/13 - 27K TA + 5K fellowship WILL ATTEND
Johns Hopkins: Rejected via email 4/10
U Virginia: WAITLISTED via email 2/24 - Withdrew Application 3/29
U Chicago: Rejected via email to check website 2/9
U Michigan : Rejected via email 3/13

I had strong test scores but not a great research profile, so I applied to many top 30 schools figuring that if I have a ~10% chance of getting into one, then by applying to many my odds would be a lot better. Fortunately, it worked. I got a healthy amount of rejections, but my acceptances gave me some leeway to choose where I thought I would be happiest. While UT-Austin is perhaps a more highly regarded program, UMD just happens to be a better fit for me. Hopefully my profile will help future applicants.

ADVICE: If you want to maximize your chances of getting into school, start research early. But it's okay to have a balanced life and not research until 3rd year because you can still get into school. If you are domestic like me, it might be smart to focus your applications towards upper level public schools, as I fared a lot better with them.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Tutored and volunteered for SPS

Special Bonus Points: My recommendations are pretty solid, and cover both the nuclear and astro fields. I contacted a potential advisor at UChicago about cosmic-ray research and we had a Skype meeting. He knows one of my recommenders, so there's possible brownie points in that *crosses fingers*.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:
I'm semi-fluent in German....so that might be a good thing?

Applying to Where:

All of the following are for experimental research...

University of Chicago - Physics (Nuclear) -> Rejected by e-mail (3/3)
University of Chicago - Astronomy & Astrophysics (Cosmic-Ray) -> Rejected by e-mail (2/9)
Michigan State University - Physics (Nuclear) -> Rejected by e-mail (3/12)
Duke University - Physics (Nuclear) -> Rejected by e-mail (2/11)
University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill - Physics (Nuclear) -> Wait-listed by e-mail (2/14) -> *ACCEPTED!!!* by e-mail (4/1) [TA Assistantship, $22,881/yr] -> WILL ATTEND!!!
North Carolina State University - Physics (Nuclear) -> Withdrew application (4/13)
University of Delaware - Physics (Cosmic-Ray/Space) -> Withdrew application (4/13)
University of South Carolina - Physics (Nuclear) -> Accepted by e-mail! (3/13) [TA Assistantship, $17,250/9 months] -> Declined Offer

Takeaway Message: The Physics GRE Exam is a terrible indicator of future success in physics...even ETS has admitted this. Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately for you), the Physics GRE Exam is objectively the most important subject GRE exam out there. If you're not at least in the 50th percentile, there's a rare chance you'll end up in the top 10. That being said, a low score will not completely ruin your chances at attending a decent school. With a 29%, I never dreamed that I'd be accepted by a school like UNC-Chapel Hill, and yet I'll be going there next fall and possibly this summer!!!

Bottom line, study study STUDY for that Physics GRE. It sucks, but it'll open so many more doors. And of course, get into research early. It wasn't just luck that UNC was able to set aside my PGRE score...I had the research experience they wanted. Keep up your grades, get involved with research, and give studying for the PGRE at least a month (and not a couple days like I did :S).

Major: Physics
GPA: 4.00
Length of Degree: 2 years (thesis track)

Type of Student: Domestic White Male (sad)

GRE Scores : (revised or old version?)

V: 167
W: 4.5
P: 820


Research Experience:
4 years molecular biophys
2 years AMO
1 REU in dark matter
1 year dark matter phenomonology (figured out the prof is totally uninterested in physics research... still brags about being a theorist)

Awards/Honors/Recognitions:
Got an REU
Was a Goldwater applicant for my school (told by advisors it wasn't worth mentioning because i didn't win or get honorable mention)
Misc. awards for being best student and researcher in both math and physics

Pertinent Activities or Jobs:
Tutored physics 6 years
tutored calc/linear/DEs 4 years
TA'd a lot of upper division math courses
TA for physics department as grad student
Good amount of paid research
SPS Physics Club secretary

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

Jazz Guitarist

Special Bonus Points:
My grad advisor worked at JQI as a postdoc. Met a several people from Maryland (though not exactly in fields I'm intending to PhD in)) at DAMOP in Madison.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:
Programming for some while, all self taught. Includes C/C++, FPGA board programming, Labview, ROOT

I have switched fields a few times... kinda worried about that looking poorly. I just like physics, but in todays age that seems like a death sentence... :/

Applying to Where: all for quantum computing except for UCSF which is for two-body problem considerations. Listed in no particular order of preference (although cali is kinda where i want to go)

UCSF - Biophysics - Nanobots - REJECTED 1/12 Form Email, Ce le vie... San Fran... :(
Stanford - Applied Physics - QElectronics - rejected; hard work down the drain :(
UC Santa Barbara - Physics - QC - rejected
UChicago - molecular engineering - QC -Asked if I wanted to be on the waitlisted by email 2/12/15, I said yes
Yale - applied physics - QC - pending
UMaryland college park - physics - QC- rejected due to personal incompetence combined with a we don't bother to email that we never received your GRE scores. Grad coordinator said he was sorry but there is nothing he could do to get my application considered at that point... so much for having ins at that school.
Wisconsin Madison - physics - QC - Accepted! $20,088 per year (assuming I find summer work) and 5k+5k first year fellowships
UT Austin - physics - QElectronics - pending (mostly b/c gf wants to go here... QC is basically one prof.)


So far it looks real bad. Going in I though my application was a lot stronger than it apparently was. Or maybe it just is a case of bad lots. Liked Madison, but seriously considering a gap year or something because its geographic location is a significant detractor for my significant other ("allergic" to the cold).

Undergrad Institution: Big State Top Ten in Physics, Top 5 in CM
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s):
GPA in Major:3.69
Overall GPA:3.78
Length of Degree: 3 years
Position in Class: Near top.
Type of Student: Domestic White Female

GRE Scores : (revised or old version?)
Q: 168
V: 158
W: 4.0
P: 830 (76%)



Research Experience: 2 years CME at my school- past year has been full time, one paper under review 2nd author (There's only been one week in my entire two years where our system was working well enough to take data :'( )

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: A few. Mostly for being a female and doing well.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: TA for two years.

Special Bonus Points: Female. Also I only applied where my advisor knew people. My advisor gets personal calls when his undergraduates apply to Cornell. Two strong letters from well established people. I've participated on an experiment at a National Lab.


Applying to Where:

All Condensed Matter Experiment but my SOP states I'm willing to do biophysics and CMT.

Stanford - Physics - REJECTED! 2/17 Can't win 'em all. Congrats to those who got in :)
Berkeley - Physics - Rejected
Santa Barbara - Physics - Accepted 2/3 - TA 26,748 Declined. I really wanted to go here but I don't want to sacrifice my standard of living. Plus I have a boyfriend coming with and it's a bit harder for him to find a job around this area.
MIT - Physics - Rejected 2/18 I wasn't going to apply here initially since there wasn't anyone I was excited about working with, but my boyfriend wanted to move to Boston. Gotta tell him the bad news.
Cornell - AEP - Accepted 2/12 - Unknown Source 24,658 for nine months. Declined. Too depressing. Great opportunity, but I'll get caught in a rut if I go here.
Columbia - Physics - Rejected.
Rutgers - Physics - Accepted 2/6 TA + Excellence + Torrey Fellowship ~29K for 10 months + 1700-4000 if TA/GSR Summer Declined.
Maryland College Park - Physics - Accepted 2/10, Offer Letter to come -> Offer letter came:
For people who want info about what kind of pay is here, 22.7k for first year, 25.2k for second year, 29k once advanced to candidacy. Living around here is kind of expensive. Commuters have to move their cars when big games happen. I received an RA offer and two fellowships which amount to 5k/year for five years. There's also national labs around which students frequently work in.
Stonybrook - Physics - Decided against applying once I got admitted to another school (I really don't want to live on long island)
Johns Hopkins - Physics - Accepted 1/22 - TA 25k for 9 months. Research over summer is an additional 8333. Possibly more funding after Open House in Feb. Declined.
Boulder - Physics - Accepted 2/18 - TA 17.4k for 9 months. RA full year should be around ~25k. 6k signing bonus. Declined. A bit sad because I like CO.
San Diego - Physics - Recommended for Admission 1/23 - Physics Excellence Award + Summer Research Fellowship. Received offer letter 2/21. Wow that took awhile.
TA: 18,538 + Excellence: 14,000 over one year + Summer Fellowship: 8,000 = 40,538 for the first year. But it looks like it goes down to somewhere around 25.5k as a 50% GSR appointment. You can do 100% GSR appointments during the summer (makes it ~31k), although I don't know how common that is.
Washington - Physics - Accepted 1/14 - TAship + 5000 -> Distributed as 1956/month + 2500 by 9/30 Declined 2/4. I hope someone gets in and can attend visiting weekend!


Some thoughts:

Ultimately, I think going somewhere you're going to be happy is really important so long as it doesn't hurt you in the long run. You're going to graduate school for the next five years of your life. This isn't something you just force yourself through to get past it. You need to be happy and enjoy what you're doing so you can succeed, even if that means not going to the highest ranked school you got accepted to. Focus on putting yourself in an environment where you will succeed. At the same time, have an idea with what you want to do after grad school and look at job placement rates, who's coming to career fairs, and linkedin data. Make sure you aren't wasting your time. Being able to learn enough programming to land a shitty job is going to be worth more than completing a PhD at some no name university unless you obtain usable skills in the process.

Applying to Where: (Mostly materials science departments with a research focus on CMP/faculty from physics)

U of British Columbia - Engineering Physics - CMP th/exp - Rejected
U of Virginia - Engineering Physics - CMP exp - 11/02 - Accepted to the PhD program! RA, $22,500 first two years, $24,000 after.
Cornell - Materials Science - CMP th/exp (Master's) - 23/02 - Accepted without funding.

UIUC - Materials Science - CMP th/exp - Rejected
ENS Lyon (Erasmus Mundus ATOSIM) - Computational Physics - 03/07 - Accepted, with funding.
______________________________________________

Since my undergraduate major is in engineering, and I have neither a perfect GPA nor any publications, the selectivity of graduate programs in physics makes it impossible to get into any of the well known schools. However, I have found that several physics faculty members working in CMP (mostly experimental, in rare cases theory) are also part of their respective schools' materials science departments. I hope that by applying to engineering physics/materials science graduate programs, my engineering background wouldn't be as much of a deterrent to admissions committees.

UPDATE - Worked! Having joined a graduate program in Materials Science, I see there is ample scope to work in experimental condensed matter physics, despite not formally belonging to the department of Physics. I assume it would be similar in other schools.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

Special Bonus Points: grad classes, possibly postitive LOR (?)

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: a previous very very crappy university degree&transcript from Abroad, then 2 years at a community college, 2 years at home US university,. a summer class at a different university on an uncommon topic in undergraduate curriculum

Applying to Where:
Univ. Minnesota Twin-Cities: Accepted Jan 28th
Stony Brook : Accepted Jan 20th. 500 people applied
New York University: Informally Accepted Jan 28nd by e-mail. Funding info to come mid Feb: a four-years fellowship. TA is optional and pay additionally. !

Boston University Accepted by e-mail Feb 11.
CMU Feb 05 wait-listed by e-mail.

Brown: rejected for PhD, accepted for paid master

*recommendation: I recommend future students to choose LOR providers who seem to think highly of you (even unreasonably high) and who believe that you can get into [the kind of your dream schools or better]. Show potential providers your profile and ask them what do they predict of the apps outcome, where should you apply, etc.. to probe their opinions of you

I was getting LORs from who know me the most but in hindsight, that is not automatically a good strategy. if prof A knows you personally well but think of you as an ordinarily good student, while prof B knows you less but somehow get the impression that you are the best of the class, then B is a better provider.

Undergrad Institution: Undergrad private university
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): Math
GPA in Major: 3.6 (3.8 upperlevel)
Overall GPA: 3.5
Length of Degree: 5 years (175+ credit hours)
Position in Class: Near top
Type of Student: Minority

Research Experience: 2 journal publications (1 first-author, 1 coauthor), 1 conference proceeding, preprint being prepared. Numerous presentations (APS Meeting, seminars, conferences). Description below:

    1) Two years on GR theory. First-authored publications in Phys. Rev. D and a conference proceeding, gave a talk at an APS April Meeting, one poster presentation, four talks at undergraduate symposiums.


    2) REU program at Top 10 school on modeling test particles in strong gravitational regimes. Wrote up a manuscript, but wasn't published.


    3) Invited for 10 weeks to work in theoretical physics (HEP-theory + differential geometry project). Coauthored publication in PLB, attended a workshop, and gave two talks at undergraduate symposiums.


    4) Currently working on theory project with LIGO, began as undergraduate thesis and continued. First-authoring publication (submission soon). Scheduled talks at a few seminars.


    5) Research assistant after a 1 year post-college break. At an Ivy working with compact binaries, gravitational waves, and E&M fields around black holes. Two talks in the department here.


Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Dean's lists, full-ride scholarship.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: SPS (Zone Councilor, President, VP, Outreach Officer). Sigma Pi Sigma (President, VP). Several grants awarded to conduct outreach efforts. Took a year off after undergrad helping high schoolers and working for disability resources at local uni.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Medical issues had an impact on academic performance, upward trend in grades. Took a lot of computer science courses (operating systems, data structures, algorithms, etc), but no minor/major in it.

Special Bonus Points: Got connections (LIGO collaborators, current advisor is well-known). Minority.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Helps to publish in your area of interest I guess.

Applying to Where: Overall interest was in gravity, relativity, and cosmology (theory and computation).

Caltech - Physics - Accepted 2/19 (website). $32k
Maryland - Physics - Rejected 2/19 (website).
PennState - Physics - Accepted 2/12 (email). $27k+.
Montana State - Physics - Accepted 1/29 (website).

Chicago - Astronomy & Astrophysics - Accepted 1/26 (phone). $35k/yr
Cornell - Astronomy & Astrophysics - Rejected 2/13 (email).

NSF Fellowship - Received 3/31. (E/E, E/E, E/E)
Ford Fellowship - Received 3/23.

Update 2/20: That sums up my application year, just waiting on fellowship results. Ifelt confident on the NSF, even my well-known advisor said she felt I had a good chance at getting it. Back in December I imagined acceptance from Cornell (astro), PennState (physics), and Montana State (physics). I felt like I was an automatic rejection from Caltech, UChicago, and Maryland. This goes to show how much you can misjudge your application.

Update 4/6: Not to sound too pretentious, but I would've been very surprised if I didn't at least get an honorable mention on the NSF. I was that confident (ended up getting three E/E's ratings). Research is essential here. Same with LORs. In the fall I feared my current advisor's LOR wasn't going to be spectacular, so 1-2 months before requesting it I really pushed my research. I think doing that really left a good impression on her. I sacrificed a good grade in the grad quantum course I was taking with this tactic. In summary, it's all about research and LORs. The exams are just to stamp you with a number to make the committees' jobs easier.

Hmm, no waitlists... This ended sooner than I was hoping...

Undergrad Institution: Top 20 Overall / Top 10 in Physics / grae's school :P
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): Computer Science
GPA in Major: 3.42 in Physics / 3.61 in all major-related courses
Overall GPA: 3.57
Length of Degree: 4
Position in Class: Close to average, but probably below average
Type of Student: Domestic, White Male

GRE Scores : Revised
Q: 170 (99%)
V: 156 (73%)
W: 5.0 (93%)
P: 800 (71%)

Research Experience:
(1) Programming-based project related to instrumentation (2 semesters + 1 summer freshman/sophomore year)
(2) Good REU (summer following sophomore year) --- 4th author of 4 author paper
(3) Project in field of interest (junior + senior year)
(4) Good REU also in field of interest (summer following junior year) --- one co-authored paper submitted after application deadlines

Awards/Honors/Recognitions:
None

Pertinent Activities or Jobs:
Leadership in two-major related clubs (SPS + astronomy club)

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:
Not really...

Special Bonus Points:
(1) I write well. I think my personal statement was well written with clear intentions.
(2) I know what I want to study in grad school and already have worked on two projects in that field.
(3) Two of my recommendation letters have already got me into two REU programs, so they can't be too bad.
(4) I've met a lot of people at AAS.
(5) I have a somewhat direct connection to someone at University of Arizona.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:
(1) Clear Downward Trend in GPA (two worst semesters came Junior Year)
(2) I have taken a difficult course load, but not unusually difficult. I don't think this will play too much of a role in vindicating me.

Applying to Where: (in order of application deadline!)
All for Theoretical / Computational
University of California - Berkeley - Astronomy - Rejected 2/19
University of Maryland - College Park - Astronomy - Accepted 1/21 by Email ($26.9K/yr w/TA)
Harvard University - Astronomy - Rejected 2/27
University of California - Los Angeles - Astronomy - Accepted 2/3 by Phone ($38K 1st yr, $29K 2nd yr --- for TA or RA)
University of Arizona - Astronomy - Accepted 1/20 by Phone ($30.2K/yr w/RA + $2.5K for Research Expenses)
California Institute of Technology - Astronomy - Rejected 2/17
University of Washington - Astronomy - Rejected 3/6
University of California - Santa Cruz - Astronomy - Rejected 2/20
University of Chicago - Astronomy - Rejected 2/9

Take Away These Points:
The worst part of my application is GPA-related, so there's not much to learn here.
Grades won't get you into grad school alone, but you still need to meet some loose threshold before they start to consider you based on research + rec letters. That threshold varies from person to person and place to place,
but is undoubtedly higher at the better, more difficult-to-get-into places and probably less loose if you are applying for theory.

So..., get good grades -- especially junior year. That counts the most. Even if you don't have the best GPA entering junior year, you can make it up junior year.
Of course, you need to do research too, so...
In the end, you always need to be looking for the right balance between courses and research.

On the flipside, the University of Arizona might have been the best research fit (at the very least, top two) out of all of the places I applied -- even the ones where I was rejected. So even in my case, research experience and skills are extremely important.

Also, don't get all of your advice from this website. Talk to your advisor(s)! :D


One More Edit:
NSF Graduate Research Fellowship -- Awarded :-)
The reviews cited the strength of having recommendations from three researchers at different institutions, having co-authored publications and also conference presentations, the familiarity with the literature in the proposed research, and having leadership positions in two clubs as key reasons for offering the award.

The result is frankly surprising to me and I think I got off lucky. What I learn from all this is to never assume that you will never be accepted into one particular school. I waited until very near the deadline to apply for MIT because I'm afraid I won't get in. Also, the PGRE is massively important, especially if you are from a small school with trivia coursework.

Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): N.A.
GPA in Major: 8.6/10
Overall GPA: 8.6/10
Length of Degree: 5 Years ( Masters' degree )
Position in Class: Not announced
Type of Student: International Male
GRE Scores : Revised
Q: 168 (95%)
V: 159 (81%)
W: 4.5 (80%)
P: 900 (85%)


TOEFL Total: 107/120

Research Experience:
Two summer internships in India working on open quantum systems. One conference paper.
Two one semester long Master's projects: both in quantum information.
Review project in neutrino physics.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Not much.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: None.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Five courses in philosophy?

Special Bonus Points: I have taken many grad courses in quantum information.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:Has a physical disability.

Applying to Where:

University of Washington- Quantum Optics, Quantum Information Rejected (2/19) Prospective adviser contacted me and said that his research interests are different from mine. Received the official rejection letter later.
Boston University - Quantum Information Rejected (4/21) At least they responded earlier that it is very unlikely that I get in.
University of Southern California- Quantum Information Rejected (05/05)
University of New Mexico- Quantum Information Rejected (4/21)
Louisiana State University- Quantum Information - Accepted (2/8) $22,000 and full tuition waiver :) - Will attend!
University of Waterloo- Quantum Information Accepted (4/22) But accepted to a Master's program with possible upgradation to a PhD program after one year upon excellent performance. Declined after a lot of thought
University of Oxford- Quantum Information - Invited for interview(2/10) Rejected Haven't heard back since the interview. Must have been rejected.
University College London- Quantum Information Rejected Haven't heard back since I applied in January. Must have been rejected.
University of Manchester- Open quantum systems Accepted (12/11) No financial support given. Declined
University of Bristol-Quantum Information Rejected (2/18) Said that there is no funding for international students.
University of Vienna- Quantum Information Rejected (1/16)

In the end, I had only one real option for a PhD with financial assistance. So selecting the grad school was easy. It was a complete waste of time applying to the UK. And they didn't even have the basic manners to respond back with a rejection letter. My conference paper apparently did me no good.
I will be joining the Quantum Science and Technology group at Louisiana State University.

Undergrad Institution: Top-ten liberal arts college, well known
Major(s): Astrophysics (a full physics major with four astronomy classes)
Minor(s): Women's and Gender Studies
GPA in Major: 3.36
Overall GPA: 3.55
Length of Degree: 4 years (graduated May 2014)
Position in Class: Above average both in school and major
Type of Student: domestic woman, under represented racial minority (Latin@)

GRE Scores: taken fall 2014
Q: 166 (92%)
V: 160 (84%)
W: 5.0 (93%)
P: 590 (27%) *forever crying*

Research Experience: Two summer REUs in observational astronomy (one at another liberal arts college, the other at a very famous museum), one summer with NASA doing planetary science, a semester of theoretical astrophysics research; presented posters at AAS two years in a row

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: GEM Fellowship recipient (applies to all but UWSeattle and CUNY); my poster from NASA won 1st place in science in their internal contest; Sigma Xi; Academic Achievement Award from school all four years; member of Prep for Prep (big deal in NYC in terms of promoting leadership and academic excellence across people of color)

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Casually worked with the physics department and observatory, currently tutor physics and math

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: While in college I was super active in promoting social justice in terms of race and religious pluralism, and also took on a lot of non-academic leadership roles. Also, I'm currently a finalist for the Fulbright Travel Fellowship.

Special Bonus Points: I'm not quite sure how to phrase this without coming off conceited, but I try to be friendly and earnest in my interactions with people, which translates to easily creating positive relationships with my mentors and coming off as charismatic in groups and to strangers. My three recommenders all like me a lot, and my NASA mentor was very impressed with the quality of my work. Additionally, the schmoozing I did at AAS this year and at departments' open houses was definitely instrumental to some of my admission decisions. One of my recommenders is a professor at my top choice school. I'm also assuming that the fact that I'm a woman of color with good research experience and decent grades is not inconsequential to how people read my application.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: My school has active grade deflation. Also, I studied physics abroad at a UK school and got good grades. In all my application, I talked a lot about how I wanted to apply my education in becoming a leader, either in the context of education or NASA missions. When it was relevant, I went into detail about my time with NASA, my eagerness to explore new topics, and my fluency in Spanish (re: Yale's program with the Universidad de Chile).

Applying to Where:
All are either PhDs in astronomy or the equivalent that the school carries unless specified, and I'm wasn't incredibly picky about what topic I'll pursue (just no heliophysics, solar system astronomy, fluid dynamics-heavy projects, or ISM).
Asterisks mark top choices; my safety was CUNY.

In order of preference:
Columbia University* Rejected 2/26 via email
University of Washington Seattle* Wait-listed over phone 2/25, phone interview 2/18
Yale University Rejected 2/23 via email
Boston University* Accepted 1/26 via phone call, visited
University of Maryland at College Park*
University of Colorado Boulder Rejected 2/13 via email
Arizona State University Accepted 2/3 via email, visited
University of Minnesota Wait-listed over email 1/29, invited to visit
University of California Riverside, Physics and Astronomy
CUNY Graduate Center, Physics Casually accepted over email 1/30, withdrew

Undergrad Institution: Big State School, Top 20 in Phys/Astro
Major(s): Astronomy, Physics
Minor(s): n/a
GPA in Major: 3.55
Overall GPA: 3.66
Length of Degree: 4
Position in Class: Average
Type of Student: Domestic Female

GRE Scores :
Q: 157 (69%)
V: 164 (93%)
W: 4.5 (80%)
P: 640 (38%) :|


Research Experience: Two summer internships with Lockheed Martin (engineering/instrumentation in the first one, solar physics in the second one). 3.5 years research at my university, 1.5 in ISM astrochemistry/spectroscopy, 2 in IGM/Circumgalactic and AGN topics. One submitted AJ first author paper, one first author paper in prep. Presented poster at Jan. 2014 AAS, was a co-author on a Hubble Observing Proposal.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Magna Cum Laude for honors thesis, Phi Beta Kappa honors fraternity scholarship

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Paper grader for 4 different astro courses, occasional volunteer at campus observatory open house, casual math/physics/astro tutoring/helproom

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: On-site observing experience at Apache Point Observatory (3.5m), certified on university's 24" telescope.

Special Bonus Points: Three grad classes

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Not really? This is my second app cycle after nothing but waitlists that ended in rejections last year, so I emphasized how much I have reflected upon my desire to go to graduate school and my SOP feels much more mature this year.

Applying to Where: All schools were astronomy programs unless astro was encapsulated in physics

Johns Hopkins - rejected 4/9 (They waitlisted me last year, I thought maybe applying again I'd have a shot)
Penn State - waitlisted 1/29
Ohio State - waitlisted 1/5, all slots filled no admission 4/11
Michigan Ann Arbor - waitlisted 3/31
Michigan State - Accepted 1/19 Declined 3/30
Wisconsin Madison - waitlisted 3/12 Accepted 4/13---Will Attend
U. Minnesota - waitlisted 1/29 Accepted 3/28
UT Austin - waitlisted 2/02, all slots filled no admission 4/14
New Mexico State - Accepted 2/13 Declined 2/17
U. Arizona - rejected 1/23
Arizona State - rejected 4/7
UC Irvine - rejected 4/6
UC Riverside - Accepted 2/11 Chancellor's Distinguished Fellowship Declined 4/7

My main takeaways after going through this god forsaken process twice are:
1) Connections are very important. Every school where I was accepted had very tangible ties to one or more of my letter writers.
2) The PGRE was more important than they say. My first cycle I was applying with a 27% and was rejected everywhere. My second cycle, I managed to pry out of my department that they had an unspoken cut-off of around 40% (a top 20 program). By getting to that floor-level score, I was admitted to all schools "below" the tier of my undergrad, and waitlisted at schools that were in a similar tier.
3) Be sure your letter writers have worked with you recently, are friendly/like you, and are not spacey (had an emeritus prof write one for cycle 1 and found out later that he writes terrible letters). If you can, poll around and see if anyone knows the quality of your letter writers before you ask that person to write for you.
4) I don't know if it had any bearing on anything, but my SOP for cycle 2 was trimmed to absolutely professional. No personal anecdotes, just my research experience, what I'd been doing since graduation, my grad school research interests, and what I wanted to do with my career.

Undergrad Institution: Elite LAC (strong reputation for STEMs fields, particularly physics)
Major(s): Physics, Math
Minor(s): Econ? (I don't know if it counts as a minor or its equivalence...)
GPA in Major: Physics: 3.95+ , math: 4.00
Overall GPA: 3.90+
Length of Degree: 4
Position in Class: Top/near top
Type of Student: International Chinese male

GRE Scores : (revised or old version?)
Q: 168
V: 166
W: 4.5
P: 990 (I didn't start studying for GRE until very late (like a week ago before the exam), but I powered through a book called Conquering Physics GRE in 4 days. And it gave me a nice result. I highly recommend this book for cramming, if you ever plan to just cram...But really,,, don't cram!)


Research Experience: 1 summer computational electrodynamics, 1 summer computational solid state, 1 summer + 1 year experimental magnetism, 5 weeks biophysics. No publications, no conferences.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: all departmental, no importance. chemistry in sophomore year, physics in junior year, math in senior year. (guess it means I'm well-rounded?)

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Tutor for a CS class. Grader for many physics classes.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:
a) I almost took all physics courses offered at my school and did three independent studies in addition. Well-trained in math, somewhat well-trained in chemistry and CS.
b) Did quite well on basically all physics classes I took. (e.g. scored 100 on the final of a very hard class, while the class average was ~60). Performances like these might matter if the recommenders brought them up in letters.
c) Actually did something useful in our lab, though not publishable, but still something worth being proud of ;)

Special Bonus Points:
a) All my recommenders know me very well and seem to like me! :D . My research advisor has many connections in the field.
b) I injured my hand the day before I got into Stanford. I think it gave me good karma. :mrgreen:

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I think I showed lots of passion for physics (which, really, is the most important thing!!)

Applying to Where: (All CME and CMT. All physics department, except for Stanford, which is Applied Physics)

Princeton-Admitted 2/19
Stanford-Admitted 1/31
UCSB-Likely letter 1/14, Admitted 1/21
MIT-Rejected 2/18
Harvard-Admitted 2/17
Caltech-Rejected
Chicago-Rejected
Yale-Waitlisted-Declined
Cornell-Admitted 2/10
Berkeley-Admitted
UIUC-Admitted 1/23
UCSD-Admitted 1/26
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry-Admitted instantly (for chillness and awesomeness)

------------
Some afterthoughts and comments:
I don't know why I didn't get into MIT. It's still a mystery to me. Before the application, I thought it was a safety school for me. There is a MIT prof who is an ex-member of our research group at college. My research interests match with his almost perfectly. My recommender was his college thesis advisor. I thought MIT was the school where professors' opinions are the most important in the admission process, so I was pretty sure I would get in... Afterwards when I visited Harvard, I went to MIT to visit this professor. He said he never saw my profile. Quite odd that MIT turned me down in the first round given my GPA and test scores. Rather a unpredictable process, indeed.

Then there's Caltech and Chicago. I was pretty sure I wouldn't get in, and I didn't. When I was applying to schools, Princeton was my #1 choice, so I pulled down their website and basically wrote my statement of purpose according to the Princeton profs. For every other school, I changed a fews words. e.g. Princeton to MIT, some Princeton prof to some MIT prof. For pretty much very every other school, it worked out okay. But for Caltech and Chicago, I felt the inconsistency in the SoP even when I was writing it, because the department focus is so different between Princeton and Caltech and Chicago. I would say I'm interested in XX in the first paragraph only to find out that "Oh Shoot, Caltech/Chicago doesn't have any prof who does XX, so let me stick some random prof that does YY, because I really don't want to change my main paragraph cuz it's the 12th SoP I'm writing in one day."
So take-home lesson: Give lots care/time to every single SoP, because the departmental difference across schools can be significant!!

Wish everyone a fruitful grad school career. :mrgreen:

Johns Hopkins - Accepted 1/22! 25K/9 months TA + 8K summers

Top 30
Minnesota - Accepted 1/28! 24K/12 months, 2 year fellowship
Rutgers - Accepted 2/6! first year fellowship 29k/10 months, plus 4k Torrey Fellowship


Reflection:
Obviously I had better luck with applied physics than physics programs. There is some discrepancy in the acceptance rate at Stanford (17% for applied, 13% regular physics) but its about 20% for each at Cornell. So it could be that applied physics programs are easier to get into, that my application is better suited for applied physics programs, coincidence, or some combination of the three.

As advice for future applicants, I think my biggest weakness is that I didn't have a long term project at my home school. This is mostly because I couldn't find what I was interested in. So my advice is to try to find what you like as soon as possible, or at least find a lab where you fit in and really work hard at a project for a couple of years so you can get a strong letter of rec.


Good luck to everyone, this year and in the future!

Undergrad Institution: Big State ~ Top 15 for physics
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): Math
GPA in Major: 3.55
Overall GPA: 3.45
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: Average-ish I think?
Type of Student: Domestic Male, kinda a minority

GRE Scores : Revised
Q: 165 (90%)
V: 166 (96%)
W: 4.0 (56%)
P: 790 (69%)

Research Experience: Worked with two labs (neuroscience and materials science), no publications.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: None

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Been teaching math/science professionally for the last 6 years and also did Peace Corps for 2 years (I'm old).

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: See above, I've done a lot of do-gooder stuff that is not exactly physics related. I've taken online courses and done some other things in my free-time in addition to teaching advanced secondary physics at both private schools in Africa and at high needs public schools in the States.

Applying to Where:

Stanford - Applied Physics - Rejected 2/2/2015
UC Berkeley - Withdrew
Princeton - Applied Physics - Rejected 2/2/2015
Cornell - Applied Physics - Accepted! - Around 25,000 for 9 months guaranteed whole career
Yale - Applied Physics - Rejected 2/2/2015
UT - Austin - Physics - Rejected 2/2/2015
CU Boulder - Withdrew
UW Madison - Physics -Accepted! - Around 20,000 for full year and a 2,000 fellowship I think
UW Madison - Medical Physics - Accepted! - Financial is not guaranteed, but seems like if you want it you get it, around 18,000 per 9 months, very informative department who even assigned a student representative to answer questions
Rice - Waitlisted and withdrew (had to e-mail for status around early March)
Duke - Physics - Rejected 2/2/2015 Medical Physics - Withdrew
UVA - Accepted! - Around 20,000 for 9 months I think plus more for the Summer
Vanderbilt Accepted!
Colorado State - Physics - Accepted! - 18,400 for 9 month TA stipend
LSU - Accepted! - Around 20,000 for the year I think

I posted these things on gradcafe, that is the best place to see timings for when people are accepted, I didn't want to dredge up all the old e-mails. My tip is to apply to a lot over a huge spread of school, as you can see above I got accepted into more selective schools than the ones I was rejected from (although it really helped I spent a Summer at Cornell and my advisor was still there. I don't know if he did anything behind the scenes for me or not). Most of the ones I withdrew from I was probably waitlisted and would not have been accepted to.

    Reflection:
    So out of boredom I compiled the results of applicants who posted on this forum between 2011-2014 who are similar to me: students at big but well known state schools in the US with a physics gpa between 3.75-3.95, PGRE between 750-950, and at least one year of research (I excluded plasma physics and astro applicants because the programs are so different). There were 22 such cases. This isn't enough to make any real conclusions but it can at least serve as a bit of guidance for future applicants. I found that these students, on average, got into 33% of schools ranked 1-7 by US News, 51% of those ranked 9-16, and 90% of those ranked 18-30. There was very little, if any, correlation between gpa, gre, and research with better results (but this is such a small sample and there are so many other factors, that it's possible such a correlation exists but just isn't obvious). Only 2 people got into all schools they applied to. Only 2 people didn't get into any 1-16 ranked schools, and no one was rejected everywhere.

    The take home message for future applicants with these or similar qualifications is to try and save up your money this next summer to apply to as many good schools as possible. You have a realistic chance anywhere, but if you only apply to 2 or 3 top schools you have a realistic chance of having to settle on somewhere else (not that that would be the end of the world). On the flip side, don't get too attached to any one school, because no acceptances are guaranteed.

    Good luck to everyone, this year and in the future!

Undergrad Institution: Agnes Scott College- tiny, women's, liberal arts college. Not known for physics or science AT ALL but known for producing top graduates in a number of fields
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): Mathematics and Spanish
GPA in Major: 3.77
Overall GPA: 3.81
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: Top 10%
Type of Student: Domestic white female

GRE Scores : revised
Q: 153 (59%)
V: 153 (52%)
W: 4.5 (80%)
P: 580 (25%) ABYSMAL, I KNOW


Research Experience:
Elsewhere: Summer of research at CERN in low engery atomic physics (2014) Summer of research at University of Michigan in high energy particle physics (2013)
At home institution: 1.5 years in astronomical exoplanetary detection (helped confirm discovery of 7 exoplanets), 1 year in computational radio astronomy, 1 year of simulation work in medical physics (uses Geant4 for simulations so kind of particle physics-y)
Publications: 1 publication (though only conference preceeding) for Michigan work in HEP data acquisition systems. Not first author
Conferences: 7 conferences for physics, presented at all of them

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Goldwater Scholarship Honorable Mention; Dean's List all undergrad semesters (except 1? can't remember); NSF Fellowship (but not all schools knew I had it before they rejected me)

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: During first two years- astronomy tutor and lab assistant, now primary physics tutor for introductory courses, public outreach job giving observatory tours to school groups, SPS President

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Gave two hour long public lectures for my work in exoplanetary detection

Special Bonus Points: Suuuuper big connection from Michigan, my advisor in HEP really helped me through the application process and wrote me excellent letters. My professors at home institution, becuse it is so small, also wrote incredible letters of rec and recommended me highly. Also, woman in physics and also a liberal arts graduate (diversity!)

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Applied for NSF Graduate Fellowship. Also, because ASC is a liberal arts school our physics courses aren't as rigorous so I'm lacking in coursework but I think my statements really stood out because I'm not a generic applicant and that liberal arts education teaches you how to write! Just goes to show you even if you BOMB the PGRE you can still get into Harvard!

Special Bonus Points: One of my letter writers is well known, particularly at some of the institutions I've applied to. We also have collaborators at several schools I've applie dto as well.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:

Applying to Where:

University of Arizona - Astronomy Accepted
University of Iowa - Physics and Astronomy Accepted
UW Madison - Astronomy Accepted
Harvard - Astronomy Accepted
University of Washington -- Astronomy Interviewed -- Offered spot in physics department -- Rejected from astro
UC Santa Barbara - Astronomy Contacted letter writer -- Rejected
University of Virginia -- Astronomy Interviewed -- Rejected

Boston University -- Astronomy Unofficial waitlist -- Rejected
UCLA - Astronomy Rejected 2/5
CU Boulder - Astronomy Rejected 2/13
Caltech - Astronomy Rejected 2/17
UC Berkeley - Astronomy Rejected 2/19
Arizona State - Astronomy Rejected

I think the biggest downfall of my application was definitely my GRE scores. I think I would have been a competitive applicant otherwise, and I'd be willing to bet that many of my rejections from places like Caltech and UC Berkeley were due to insufficient GRE scores. That being said, I do think that more and more universities are beginning to place less emphasis on GRE scores and are instead vastly more interested in your research experience. Connections are definitely not enough. Pay attention to how many grad students the advisor you're interested in working with already has -- they might not be able to justify taking on more students. If possible, attend the AAS winter meeting. I talked to a substantial number of professors and admission committee members at the meeting which may have helped seal the deal in some cases.

All in all, I think research is KEY. From what I've gathered, stellar GRE scores and a high GPA on their own will not get you into grad school. You need to have research experience for physics/astro programs. If you have all three, I'd say you're very competitive and have a very good shot of getting into top programs. But again, as long as you have research experience, I would suggest applying to a wide range of schools. Just my two cents.

______________________________________________
Life is hard. I thought my application was quite strong. The only thing that was lacking was publication (so, the take home message is that if you don't have a publication, don't ever think of any school as a safety). My professors were actually advising me to apply to more top tier schools. Even sh*ts like UPitt and Carnegie Mellon haven't replied yet. I thought I am actually overqualified for Yale (what do they think of themselves, they are Ivy league, I know that, but what else?). Actually, applying to Yale was a mistake - I should have applied to more schools whose focus is more on hard core (not sure if that word is relevant) research like UTexas and some UCs. Well, since Penn State and Ohio State have already started sending out offers, I think my chances this year is close to nil. Thinking of going to some remote part of the world and teaching English, Science and Mathematics. May be I will be able to transform life of some..at least I got a privilege of undergraduate education. Let's see where I will take myself!

Research Experience: 2 years at home institution doing high energy physics analysis. 2 summers abroad doing dark matter search and accelerator simulation.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Several awards for top students at home institution. No publication.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Math & Physics tutor for 2 years.

Special Bonus Points: Perhaps strong letters of recommendation. The first one from our research group PI who always supports me. The second one from a professor at a university in Japan but has strong connection with top schools in the U.S., whom I worked with over the summer. I did not work with the professor who wrote the third letter, but took two classes with him, one of which was graduate-level.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: 2 grad-level courses. Well-crafted SOP.

UIUC - Accepted 2/9
Yale - Rejected 2/16

Some words to future applicants:
1. Study for the Physics GRE seriously. I underestimated it at first and had only one or two weekends to prepare for it. As a result, it becomes the weakest part of my application. The average scores for most schools in top 7 are between 900 and 950.
2. Spend your summers doing research elsewhere other than your home institution. You'll get exposure to different research cultures, recognize your bad habits, and establish connections with potential future colleagues.
3. Apply to as many places as you can, especially to schools higher than your anticipated match. For most top schools, other than several outstanding applicants who immediately got admission without a second thought, the committees have to choose around 40 out of 100 applications with very similar profiles. Luck plays a role.
4. This forum is an excellent resource where you can find applicants with similar profiles and base on their results to make a proper list of schools to apply to. After everything is over, please post your own profile and results to help future applicants.

<Advice to those who are applying as experimental physics>
* As an experimentalist, it is extremely crucial that you “ACE” every undergrad physics course rather than just taking tons of grad courses. (Of course, this may not apply to theorists)
* Working with one established PI for a long time helps. You can possibly publish something, or at least get a good rec-letter.
* In supplementary material, show that you can actually understand and define what you did in the lab. Do not just say "I have first author papers, so I am super-smart."

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Dean's List. Named scholar at my institution.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs:

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

Special Bonus Points: Took a few physics grad courses (Mech, E&M, QM, QFT), did well in one grad course in my junior year (the prof. was eager to write a really good rec. letter for me, though it's not a research-related one so it might not be too relevant). The other two rec. letters were from the profs I did research with, both are pretty big names in the field, and I believe wrote strong rec. letters. (like what 99% of people here say..lol)

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Although (or because) I had no publications by the time of application, I wrote a research summary of the theory project I'm currently working on, emphasizing what I actually did and learned while providing a reasonably comprehensive overview/motivation of the project.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Looking back at my undergrad career and analyzing the posts uploaded in the forum (yes, I've studied admission profiles back from ~2012..creep much?), I have a few words of advice, especially for prospective theorists (this applies to those who are aiming for top 10-20 schools):

1. All other things being equal, theory is much harder to get in than experiment. I haven't seen many acceptances among theory applicants here, despite having fantastic stats. This has less to do with the discrepancy in the stats of applicants than the very nature of the field. There are fewer professors in theory, and as far as I know, each professor only takes in 1-2 grad students at the most each year. So, if you are uncertain whether you want to follow the footstep of Sheldon or Leonard (Big Bang Theory, anyone?), it would be wiser to apply to experiment (though your undergrad research experience will suffice for you to decide which one you prefer).

2. To stand a chance at doing theory, get good grades and PGRE (at least ~900). Although there are exceptional cases, these are rarer for applicants in theory than in experiment (where there seems to be more leeway; but they seem to value research experience more). Sure, PGRE may not reflect your physics ability, but if you can't even solve simplified optics/mechanics/e&m/qm problems (some say it's the time pressure, but you can score reasonably high even without doing all problems) how can you call yourself a theorist? Same for coursework. Try to get your fundamentals straight and know undergrad physics cold before even thinking of unifying GR and QM (i.e. don't become one of those "oh-I-read-the-elegant-universe-so-I-know-string-theory-and-D-branes" guy)

3. OK. Papers. Of course, having 1 or more first-author publication at respectable journals will help you stand out. However, having no publications doesn't mean it's the end of the world - far from it. I've seen several without any (but still with near-perfect scores and research experience) who got into top schools, where many with first-author pubs were rejected. In my opinion, these schools look for applicants who will be a good fit to their department, whether through the SOP, rec. letters, etc.

4. Chill. There are plenty of good places and professors where you can study theoretical physics. Studying Ads/CFT correspondence at Princeton may sound really cool, but that's just a part of your life. IMO, having fun and meeting/dating people (i.e. those who actually think "lagrangian" isn't a word) is equally important, if not more, than the actual academic work you do. So, work hard and play hard guys, and to those applying this year, good luck wherever you all end up!

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:

Applying to Where:

All CMT/HEP-TH

Cornell - Physics Accepted - $27k with $5k teaching award
Princeton - Physics - Rejected
Columbia - Physics - Rejected

Cambridge - MASt, Part III of Tripos Accepted Conditional on 1st Class Honours Turned down due to no funding offer.

Undergrad Institution: UC Davis
Major(s): Physics, Mathematics

GPA in Major: 4.0 Physics, 3.99 Math
Overall GPA: 3.99
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: top/near top
Type of Student: Domestic White Male

GRE Scores :
Q: 170 (98%)
V: 164 (93%)
W: 5.0 (93%)
P: 990 (94%)


Research Experience: One summer of research in mathematical biology, 1 year in HEP-TH/Mathematical Physics. No publications (but one in preparation), no talks.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Dean's List every term, Scholarship for good grades.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Worked as a drop-in tutor for the university in math/physics since January of my Junior year, including over the summer.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Had almost all A+s in physics. Two majors in 4 years, if that counts for anything.

Special Bonus Points: I took a grad QFT course in my Junior year and received an A+. I've also been involved in reading/group study courses in mathematical physics or high energy theory since the beginning of my Sophomore year, which led directly to my research. Most of this was done with one professor, so his letter was probably very good, but the other two may not have been as strong.

Applying to Where: All for HEP-TH/Strings...

University of Michigan - Accepted! 1/14
Stony Brook - Accepted! 1/18
UCLA - Accepted! 2/11
Stanford - Rejected 2/17
MIT - Rejected 2/18
UC Berkeley - Accepted! 2/18
Princeton - Accepted! 2/19
Columbia - Accepted! 2/19
Caltech - Rejected 2/23
UC Santa Barbara - Rejected 2/24
Harvard - Rejected 3/02
Rutgers -

------------------------------------------------------------

To any future applicants, especially in High Energy Theory: this field is becoming increasingly competitive - try to get as much research experience as you can and study a ton for the PGRE. I highly recommend "Conquering the Physics GRE" for reviewing: it comes with a quick overview of every topic you need, and includes several practice tests. Many actual GRE questions seemed right out of this book.

I feel very lucky to have the acceptances I did get - it shows that you don't need a first author publication to get into the top 10 (but it definitely would have helped). Best of luck to anyone still waiting and to future applicants!

Undergrad Institution: Big Ten School, strong reputation in physics
Major(s): Engineering Physics

Research Experience: Summer and semester with the physics of music lab. Studied 1/f noise in carbon composition and thick film resistors. Wrote senior thesis on this research. 1 talk at symposium.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Honorable mention at poster session.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Tutor in math for 1 semester. Much leadership and public relation experience in senior supervisor position at calling center on campus.

Special Bonus Points: First person in my family to pursue PhD.

Applying to Where: All astrophysics. Mostly experimental, sprinkled with theory.

Columbia - Rejected - 3/27 via email to check website
Ohio State - Wait listed - 2/19 via email - Rejected - 3/31 via email

Brown - Wait listed - 2/25 via email - Application Withdrawn 4/9
NC State - Admitted - 2/2 via email to check website - $21,212/year TA - Will Attend!

Afterthoughts:
In all, I suppose I was shooting pretty high. I only had one research experience, which hurt me in the long run. My GPA was not competitive enough for the programs I was applying to either. My original list was the first 7 schools above, but after I received my PGRE score, I added the last two (which I'm very glad I did). I knew that score was not as competitive as other applicants to the same programs.

Don't take the PGRE lightly! You should study, study, study for that thing. I also probably spent too much time at my job on campus (~16 hrs/week) as opposed to focusing on classes and research. Your higher level physics classes will matter. Do not put research off until the summer before your senior year. Talk to the professors at your institutions if they take on undergraduates as I'm sure many of them do. Do not be shy or think you won't get a research position because that will be hurtful in the long run. Start early with research. The more experience you get, the stronger case you can make for yourself in your statement of purpose, and if your research was good, you will get an outstanding letter of recommendation. Lastly, the people applying to those programs are as serious as you, and competition is stiff.

______ _____________________________________

I guess I knew what I was getting into applying for theory. Not having publications certainly didn't help. One thing that bothers me is that I have no idea how my undergraduate university is viewed by others. I'm worried that prejudice against my university hurt my chances. But that is probably just me being paranoid. Or maybe my SoPs had red flags that were invisible to me and would have been caught if I had more people read them. The universities I felt were best fits for my interests have mostly rejected me making me wonder if my SoPs for those schools came off as too enthusiastic.

I don't know what my future in physics is. The market for tenure-track positions is horrible, especially for hep-th. My understanding is that a PhD from a top school is basically a requirement for a tenure-track position at a research oriented university. Even the latest faculty hire in my Nth tier undergrad department is from a top ten. Do I really have a chance? And is the chance big enough to gamble the next decade of my life on? I guess this is all just more motivation to do a stellar job in grad school.

Undergrad Institution: Small public liberal arts university
Major(s): Math and Physics
Minor(s): None
GPA in Major: 3.81
Overall GPA: 3.63
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: My class had three physics majors. I was the top.
Type of Student: Domestic male

Graduate Institution: Large public university in same state (leaving with an M.S.)
Major(s): Physics
Graduate GPA: 3.81
Length of Degree: 5 years
(This is probably the part that most hurt me)

GRE Scores : (revised)
Q: 170 (98%)
V: 167 (97%)
W: 4.0 (56%) I probably should have left the essay blank, now it looks like I tried
P: 820 (74%)


Research Experience:
About two years in Density Functional Theory, another nearly two years in Transformation Optics. I got most of one paper finished from the later research, but my research advisors were very resistant to it, so it was not yet published at the time of application. I listed this as my reason for switching schools.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions:
Dean's List most semesters, school scholarships, HOPE scholarship, Outstanding Physics Major Award.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs:
I've been a TA all through my masters, as well as an RA, and also a tutor for several years.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:
I think I wrote a pretty good statement of purpose. I already have an A-average in a graduate program in physics, and already passed on set of preliminary and qualifying exams.

Special Bonus Points:
Already an experienced TA and RA?

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:
I am "transferring" from another Ph.D. program five years in to it. It was a bad decision to stay here as long as I have. I should have left sooner, when I realized the research interests don't fit my interests. On applications, this ends up looking very bad. My letters were weak. I didn't get a long well with most of the important professors in my department, and the professor who would have known me best was my advisor and did not want me to leave. Not having letters from past research advisors probably especially hurt my applications.



Applying to Where: all physics, all theory. in order of decision date

UNC - Rejected 2/6/15 ... aaaand my safety rejects me right out of the gate :cry:
Duke - Rejected 2/11/15
Stanford - Rejected 2/17/15

Berkeley - Rejected 3/12/15
Georgia Tech - Waitlisted 3/13/15 - Rejected 4/14/2015
Johns Hopkins - Rejected 4/10/15

So, time to start looking for jobs open to an M.S. Physics holder :|

Undergrad Institution: Private University in South Korea. low ranked school in my country.
Major(s):Physics
Minor(s):
GPA in Major:
Overall GPA:4.0/4.5( A+ 4.5 A 4.0 B+ 3.5 etc....) which is about 3.56 in 4.0scale if apply brute proportionality
Length of Degree: 4years but almost 3years because didn't take much class in 4th year. Applied at 3rd year. This is second round of applying.
Position in Class: don't know how to know this. maybe within 1st quartile.
Type of Student: International, male

GRE Scores : revised
Q:165 this is for children.
V:155 too much vocabularies i don't know.
W:3.0 I off-topic-ed because there were some word i don't know in prompt. Generally I can't write fast or generate content at all.
P:990 breeze


TOEFL Total: Total109 R29 L30 S23 W27. Can't speak. The rest are breeze but really struggled to barely meet minimum score for speaking section. Almost spent too much time. I might be eligible for linguistics minor.

Research Experience: Senior thesis on CMT

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: none.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: none.

Special Bonus Points: none.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Didn't take much math course for theorist. Not close with LOR writer. Never meet them outside classroom. So LOR might not align with my interest. Not eloquent SOP, had not done much prospective school research. Wrote it in last minutes. My interest is HET, but didn't mention string theory because reading all posts i'm scared of being rejected by being too specific. I wrote most ambiguously that i'm interested in mathematical aspect of physics. Maybe i shouldn't. These things that I regret.

Applying to Where: All HEP-th

Stony Brook - rejected first rejection first week of febuary
Duke -Waitlisted upon inquiry
Rutgers - waitlisted

Undergrad Institution: Liberal Arts School, very much unknown physics program.
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): Mathematics, Music
GPA in Major: 3.60
Overall GPA: 3.62
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: near-top, 2nd
Type of Student: Domestic white guy

GRE Scores : revised
Q: 157 - 68%
V: 155 – 67%
W: 3.5 – 38% (got a 4.0 previously, but more is gained about your writing skills from your statement than gre, so meh.)
P: 650 - 40% <- took me 2 years but I finally nailed a decent score!

Research Experience: Senior Thesis / SCE on a custom acoustics experiment, individually presented at a large academic conference; Adv. Lab coursework presented at an academic poster-session with classmates; Currently working on R&D as technician for 2 years, modeling/studying electrochemistry and fluid dynamics. No publications or authorships :(

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: some departmental award/scholarship thing my junior year for outstanding something or other; 7 semesters on deans list; graduated cum laude; eagle scout?

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Intro physics lab TA for 5 semesters w/ grading; served as president and senate rep for SPS; served as alumni relations and historian for national fraternity. (careful to word as anonymous service org on apps, some profs are extremely biased against fraternities :|)

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: my senior thesis was an experiment I spearheaded, I came up with the idea and built the whole thing myself, gotta be worth something; I also interned 1 summer at a large science center.

Special Bonus Points: Small school means personal LOR’s, especially when you have hung out with a few profs and gotten to know each other on more than just an academic level. I know at least 2 of mine are good quality.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I’ve always been highly involved with music, was part of numerous ensembles and organizations. Was actually brownie points for 1 school, talked about it with head of admissions.

Applying to Where:

Case Western - CME - Accepted, 24k/year. Will attend.
University of Pittsburgh - CME - Waitlisted, got an email asking if I was still interested after 4/15, never replied.
Ohio University - CME - Accepted, 20k/year after "mandatory expenses".
William & Mary - CME - Accepted, 24k/year.
Dartmouth - CME - Rejected after 4/15, first I had heard from them.
Notre Dame - CME - Waitlisted, told them I had already accepted elsewhere.
Kent State - CME - Accepted after 4/15, 21k-24k/year pending summer research.
Penn State - CME - Rejected 3/5.



Welp, I finally did it. Got accepted to a number of places including my top choice, which is so much better than not getting accepted anywhere last year. Living proof that taking a year or two off in between b.s. and grad school isn't the end of the world!! I got some work experience under my belt, and can make my way around a lab like a pro. Also, proof that PGRE really is a gatekeeper for most acceptances. took a full summer of prep work but I made it happen, and you can too!!
PROTIP: get this book. http://www.physicsgreprep.com/. This resource made 100% of the difference, it's crazy how many specific things in that book were on my test.

Hope this post helps someone who had less than impressive scores, check my results last year. 500 club baby.

Undergrad Institution: Small Liberal Arts College
Major(s): Astronomy, Physics
Minor(s): Math
GPA in Major: ~3.5
Overall GPA: ~3.4
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class:
Type of Student: Domestic male

GRE Scores : (revised or old version?)
Q: 163 (86%)
V: 161 (87%)
W: 5.0 (93%)
P: 580 (25%) :roll:


Research Experience: 3 years of work as a research assistant, 1 summer at home institution in observational stellar, 1 summer elsewhere in observational extragalactic, senior thesis in computational stellar (total of 4 conference presentations)

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: one year as TA-ish job for mainly intro classes

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: see below

Applying to Where: (all for extragalactic astronomy, mix of combined (phys/astro) and separate (astro only) departments)

Boston University - waitlisted- Accepted, 31.5k/year
Florida Institute of Technology - Accepted, no emails from department about funding... :x
George Mason University - Accepted, 18k/9months as RA
Georgia State University - Accepted, 20k/year
Indiana University - Accepted, 26k/year for first two years, then down to 20k/year
New Mexico State University - waitlisted- withdrew
RIT - waitlisted- withdrew
Texas A&M - Accepted, 22k/year, plus 2k extra for first year
UCLA - Rejected
UC Riverside - Rejected

University of Kansas - waitlisted- withdrew
UMass Amherst - waitlisted- withdrew
UMBC - waitlisted- Accepted, 24k/year
University of Oklahoma - Accepted, 19.2k/year

I was terrified when I got my PGRE score back- I really thought I didn't have any shot at grad school this year. I had also been rejected to all of the over two-dozen REU programs I applied to the summer before, but persisted and found some work with a great professor. My rec letter writers all thought I had a pretty good shot at a fair number of the schools on my list, and I stuck with it. I think my letters of recommendation and research experiences were quite strong, and those seem to matter a lot more than your PGRE score or GPA (particularly in astronomy).

Moral of the story: you can get into grad school (on the first try!) with a not-so-great PGRE.

Anyways, PM me if you see this and have any questions about the application process, particularly if you're in a similar situation. I'd be happy to help :)
