Undergrad Institution: Average size state school, known for engineering
Major(s): Physics / Mathematics
GPA in Major: 3.5
Overall GPA: 3.4
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: >50%
Type of Student: Domestic white male

GRE Scores
Q: 162 (82%)
V: 155 (68%)
W: 4.0 (59%)
P: 700 (51%)


Research Experience: Three years on the same particle experiment. Work led to several presentations for the group. My name is on two published papers which both have 50+ authors.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: I got a physics scholarship, and am planning on graduating with departmental honors.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Nationally certified physics tutor for 2 semesters.

Special Bonus Points: Got a good grade in a grad level physics class. I’m also a first generation college student. Probably neither of those matter and I didn't mention them anywhere. I do have an upward trend in GPA: 3.8 over the last 3 semesters.

Applying to: Other Rejected Accepted

New Mexico – HEPex: email 1/30
Colorado State – HEPex: email 1/31
Texas A&M - HEPex: Withdrawn 2/1
New Mexico State – HEPex: email 2/21
Arizona – HEPex: Waitlist 3/2
Colorado Boulder – HEPex: email 3/3
Utah – Cosmic Ray Experiment: email 3/7
Oregon State – HEPex: Waitlist 3/14
Arizona State – Instrumentation: ASU email 3/27

Pert' near exactly what I expected to happen. Assuming rejection from waitlist schools here at the end of March. I had detailed conversations with faculty at 4 schools, 3 of which accepted me. I had canned or no responses from faculty at the other 4. My advisor personally knew faculty at 3 institutions - 1 acceptance and 2 rejections. My personal statement listed specific faculty at 6 schools, went 4/6 on those - rejected by the other two. Thats plenty of data for you to overanalyze.

The schools are listed by date of response, but I had in mind that I applied to 2 "safety-ish" schools, 5 "match" schools, and 2 "shot-in-the-dark" schools. Good luck with your applications, and remember a PhD anywhere puts you in the most-educated 3% of the USA. How could an employer turn that down?

I decided to fill this out in an effort to cope with my freaking out about this whole process.

My background: I graduated in 2009 and have been in the workforce in mostly non-technical positions for the past 7.5 years. I am so bored and unchallenged, and I really miss physics. I am still not 100% sure that getting my PhD is the right path (omg the lost earnings), but I am seriously enough interested that I want to start going through the process. I've been studying for the PGRE for about 2 months now, and that's obviously been very stressful since I am basically re-teaching myself all my undergrad work.

Undergrad Institution: Undergrad-only institution, no real physics rep that I am aware of (~4000 students total, ~30 in Physics each year) ((hm, I was on my alma mater's physics dept website the other day and saw they are claiming a #8 ranking for physics from someone))
Major(s): Astrophysics
Minor(s): Spanish Language Studies
GPA in Major: 4.0
Overall GPA: 3.92
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: near top
Type of Student: white domestic female

GRE Scores :
Q: 170 (97%) (2016)
V: 170 (99%) (2016)
W: 4.0 (59%) (2016)
P: 820 (74%) (2016)

Research Experience: Basically none. I did one semester of a research elective and had my name on an extremely minor paper (not even sure it counts as a paper).

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Phi Kappa Phi

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: President of the Astronomy Club for 2 years, had one astronomy tutee, and did do some technical training and work in a semi-related field after graduating (nuclear engineering and operations)

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Sadly, no

Special Bonus Points: Not sure that being a woman should be considered bonus points, but I am one. Also a former Navy officer, but not sure if that would matter.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I'm old (29)!

Applying to Where:

My main interest is in planetary astronomy (exoplanets) but I'm not 100% set on that. This list is a bit in flux--I know I'm shooting high and trying to figure out where I have a real chance.

Caltech - Geological and Planetary Sciences | Submitted 22 Nov - Rejected 14 Feb
MIT - Physics | Submitted 25 Nov - Skype Interview 6 Jan - Accepted 9 Feb - ~$3k/month stipend for first year (afterwards RA/TA) - DECLINED
UC Berkeley - Astrophysics | Submitted 30 Nov - Phone Interview 13 Jan - Rejected 9 Feb
University of Chicago - Astronomy and Astrophysics | Submitted 2 Dec - Accepted 26 Jan - $32,300 stipend + $8,000 scholarship - WILL ATTEND! :D
University of Washington - Astronomy | Submitted 30 Nov - Rejected 3 Mar
University of Hawai'i - Manoa - Astronomy | Submitted 23 Nov- Accepted 17 Feb - ~$31,500 stipend for first year - DECLINED
University of Texas - Austin - Astronomy | Submitted 7 Dec- Rejected 13 Apr

I am very surprised and thrilled with my results! Everyone I know (outside the field) is like duh pick MIT but I feel like, while they may have wider name recognition in general, UChicago and MIT are really pretty equivalent in terms of quality, rankings, etc. NO clue what I am going to do!!

Final edit: WOW that was a tough decision. I changed my mind a dozen times in the last day before accepting, there were tears, there were sleepless nights. In the end, I just had to go with the one that was best for me as a whole. I know I will be fine and would have been with any choice, so it's just focusing on the future now. Best of luck to everyone!!

Undergrad Institution: Big state school in California, known for Engineering, Astronomy program has been very successful over the last 5 years!
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): N/A
GPA in Major: 4.00
Overall GPA: 4.00
Length of Degree: 4 yrs
Position in Class: Top
Type of Student: International Male

GRE Scores : (revised )
Q: 161 (79%)
V: 159 (82%)
W: 5.0 (93%)
P: 970 (93%)


Research Experience: Been working as a collaborator for the Milky Way Project https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/povich/milky-way-project, a citizen science initiative for the past year. I resurrected this international collaboration with my mentor's help and we are re-launched it last September. I developed a data reduction pipeline to aggregate all the clicks made by the volunteers in order to produce a catalog of interesting astrophysical phenomena. My mentor mentioned that this process was done by a University of Oxford post-doc prior to him leaving for a data science job at Google. We couldn't run his code effectively so I developed my own pipeline to handle this task. A first author publication is being prepared and I am expecting a couple of Nth author papers to come out of this in the next couple of years.
I've also concurrently conducted Physics Education Research (PER) with a different mentor. My project was on understanding how lower-division students enrolled in calculus-based physics courses tackled continuous charge distributions. Another first author paper, based on this research, is being prepared for publication.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: AAS FAMOUS grant, Departmental Scholarship, President's list, Dean's list, etc..

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Worked as a Learning Assistant for 2 quarters (lower div physics). Currently employed as a Student assistant at the College of Science advising center and as a student ambassador for the university. I will also be working as a grader during my senior year for lower-div/upper-div physics courses.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Worked on two research projects concurrently! I also helped revive the Milky Way Project :)

Special Bonus Points: The Astronomy professors in my department have good connections with many universities (Harvard, Caltech, University of Wisconsin, Penn State, etc)

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: N/A

Applying to Where:

Undergrad Institution: Top 10 Private
Major(s): Math, Physics
Minor(s):
GPA in Major:
Overall GPA: 3.29
Length of Degree: 4
Position in Class: Middle
Type of Student: Domestic white male

Masters Institution: Top 30 Private
Major(s): Physics
Overall GPA: 3.67
Length of Degree: 1.5

GRE Scores :
Q: 170 (November 2014)
V: 167
W: 5.0
P: 960 (April 2014)

Research Experience: Working on spectroscopic experiments and simulations of condensed matter systems (~9 months) at masters institution. One or two n-th author papers in the works; new project might yield first or second author, but unlikely to come out in time to affect applications.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions:

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: TA (2 undergraduate courses, 1 graduate(!) course)
Worked for a while as a software engineer between undergrad and masters (unsure if this helps?)

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Some math stuff from undergrad, doubt it will make a difference (study abroad program, reading program)

Special Bonus Points: I expect a pretty strong LOR from my current advisor

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Clearly, I messed up undergrad; no research experience and low GPA precluded most PhD programs. Worked for a while in industry as a software engineer before deciding to go back to school, so if nothing else I have great technical skills. My strong GRE got me into a good master's insitution, and I think I've managed to make the most of it so far. I'm unsure how my "non-traditional" background is going to play out, so I'm applying to a wide spectrum of schools and see what I get.

Applying to Where: (All in Condensed Matter Experiment)

Stanford - Rejected 2/10 via email
UPenn - Accepted 1/27 via email Will attend
UCSB - Rejected 2/24 via email to check website
UCLA - Accepted 2/16 via email
UC Boulder - Accepted 2/16 via email
UC Berkeley - Rejected 3/8 via email
Princeton - Rejected 2/16 via email
MIT - Rejected 2/10 via website
Hopkins - Waitlisted 4/12 via email (declined)
Harvard - Rejected 2/16 via email
Caltech - Rejected 2/24 via email
NYU - Accepted 1/31 via email
Columbia - Waitlisted 3/15 via inquiry - Rejected 4/10 via website

Edit 4/15: In retrospect it seems I picked about the right level of schools, thanks largely to very good advice from my advisor. I had several strong offers to choose from, and was very interested in all of them (except maybe UCLA, which I did not feel was a good research fit after visiting). Of course I was disappointed at some of the rejections, but it seems this year was very competitive for CME.

The only mistake I feel I made was not reaching out to professors before applying. Most of my SOPs listed particular groups I was interested in, and I think I was considered more seriously at the one or two schools where I had discussed it with them before.

First, thanks to everyone who posted in these threads in previous years. Can't believe it's my turn!

Undergrad Institution: Big state, meh reputation in physics
Major(s): Physics and math
Minor(s): Nada
GPA in Major: 4.00
Overall GPA: 4.00
Length of Degree: (Are you graduating after 3, 4, or 5 years?) 4 years
Position in Class: (No numbers needed, but are you top? near top? average? struggling?) Top, but I don't think grad schools actually care.
Type of Student: (Domestic/International, male/female, minority?) Domestic white male

GRE Scores :
Q: 170 (97%)
V: 167 (98%)
W: 4.5 (82%)
P: 990 (94%, October 2015)


Research Experience: (At your school or elsewhere? What field? How much time? Any publications (Mth author out of N?) or conference talks etc...) In chronological order: One summer doing computational cosmology, two semesters working on some cool gravitational lensing stuff, a summer working on topological superconductors, and about a year doing things related to TQFT. Six published papers: one in cosmology, two in gravitational lensing, one in superconductivity, and two in TQFT-related things. All are first author, and one of the TQFT ones is by myself. Two more TQFT-ish papers submitted (both second author) and another in prep. Also worked on some algebraic geometry stuff for a semester, if that counts for anything.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: (Within your school or outside?) A few local scholarships and the Goldwater

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: (Such as tutor, TA, SPS officer etc...) Ha!

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: A few talks at my school, a talk at an APS meeting, and posters at a few conferences.

Special Bonus Points: (Such as connections, grad classes, famous recommenders, female or minority status etc...) O(10) grad classes in math and physics, plus a supervised independent study on representation theory in particle physics. Attended a really kickass summer school on topological quantum matter and learned a ton from that. Also took a month off of school during fall of my senior year to hang out at the KITP (totally worth it).

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Am applying for theory but didn't take a QFT class until this semester, since my school is weird and doesn't offer it very often (went through most of Peskin and Schroeder and Fradkin's books, though). Also did a bit of lecturing for a study group on category theory in physics.

Applying to Where: All for topological CMT stuff, but also interested in quantum information, and some hep-th (it from qubit stuff). In no particular order,

MIT - Accepted, 2/9/2017 Attending! Yay c:
Yale - Accepted, 3/1/2017 Declined
UCSD - Accepted, 1/8/2017 Declined
Caltech - Accepted, 2/15/2017 Declined
Stanford - Accepted, 2/10/2017 Declined :--(
Harvard - Accepted, 2/10/2017 Declined
Boulder - Accepted, 1/26/2017 Declined; no skiing or climbing for me :--(
UCSB - Accepted, 1/31/2017 Declined :--(
Princeton - Accepted, 2/10/2017 Declined
Chicago - Accepted, 1/24/2017, Yoichiro Nambu fellowship Declined

Also, applying for

NSF GRFP - Awarded! c:
Hertz - got a first round interview - got a second round interview - AWARDED! $250,000 award, mega-psyched. Got lucky on this one.
NDSEG - Awarded! c:

####################

Unsolicited advice for future applicants: Get involved in research early, and make a point of trying your hand in several different research areas. I was introduced to CMT after doing astro research only because I thought it'd be fun to do more math, and not because I thought CMT was particularly cool. I'm very glad I did, and I think it's good to use the freedom you have as an undergrad to explore different fields. Also, don't obsesses and worry about people who have been doing physics longer than you or go to fancier schools—I got a D in AP physics (and graduated high school with a 2.7 GPA!), so you don't need to be a crazy physics prodigy to get into good schools. Lastly, if you're the kind of person who would enjoy having an oral final exam in one of your physics classes, you should totally apply for the Hertz fellowship: they ask you awesome technical questions in the interviews, which are tons of fun. Good luck!

Undergrad Institution: Big state school, not much reputation for anything but football and racism
Major(s): Physics and math
Minor(s): German and Russian
GPA in Major: 3.92
Overall GPA: 4.0
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: Not sure, probably near the top but not very top
Type of Student: Domestic white female

GRE Scores :
Q: 169 (97%)
V: 168 (98%)
W: 4.5 (82%)
P: 990 (94%) (this forum was invaluable for study material recommendations; I got like 20 questions right on my first practice test and was convinced I would fail the PGRE and have to do my PhD in nuclear engineering instead)

Research Experience: Two years HEPex at my school. Three summer internships at universities/national labs: one in materials science, one in nuclear physics, one in plasma physics. Presented a few posters at conferences in student sessions. No publications.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Full tuition merit scholarship at my school, Dean's List or better every semester, won an award for best student poster at my plasma internship.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Three semesters as an undergraduate Learning Assistant. Apparently I'm pretty good at that.

Special Bonus Points: Well, I'm a girl (and gay, but I'm only mentioning that on apps that want a diversity statement). I just went to a conference in the field I want to study in, so hopefully I made a good impression. My poster didn't win anything but I talked to a lot of professors, and got some interest from WVU and the Max Planck Institute. Friendly with professors at two schools I'm applying to (they helped me with my Fulbright application). My reference writers seem to think I'm awesome, not sure how well-connected they are.

Applying to Where:

Position in Class: Top
Type of Student: American male

GRE Scores :
Q: 170 (97%)
V: 170 (99%)
W: 4.5 (82%)

-My background was not originally in physics (or in STEM at all). I imagine some schools would view my success upon transitioning positively, and some might view transitioning negatively. I've heard that MS students are put under harsher vetting than undergrads. Maybe that would factor in as well.

Applying to Where:
All applications are for Physics, Condensed Matter.
My emphasis is in both CMT and CME, with a preference towards theory.

I've been lurking on these forums for the past couple of years. It's been more than helpful in my preparations for going to grad school. Now that it's my turn to apply, I'm excited to the return the favor! :D

Undergrad Institution: Big state university. Good engineering program, but not too well-known for physics
Major(s): Physics & Mathematics
Minor(s): University-specific research minor
GPA in Major: 4.0
Overall GPA: 4.0
Length of Degree: 4 Years
Position in Class: No numbers, but probably near the top
Type of Student: Domestic white male

GRE Scores :
Q: 168 (95th)
V: 155 (68th)
W: 4.0 (59th)
P: April 2016: 660 ; September 2016: 740; October 2016: 820 (74th)

Research Experience: 3 years of HEP-ex research with the same faculty adviser. No proper publications, but my name is on a couple internal analysis notes and other official reports/papers. Along with this, I spent the summer of 2015 doing an REU for HEP-ex, and this past summer (2016) I had a non-REU research position doing quality control on components for particle detectors.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Received a full-tuition scholarship from my school. President's List every semester so far. Was awarded "Outstanding First-Year Physics Student." Had a small monetary award for my physics grades during my freshman year as well.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: I've been working as an undergrad TA for the past 3 years. For my sophomore and junior years, I assisted with entry-level mechanics and electromagnetics courses (both algebra-based and calculus-based, as well as honors and non-honors). This year, I'm assisting with our junior-level electromagnetics course.

I've presented my research at a university-wide conference two years in a row. During my REU, I did a poster presentation at an end-of-summer symposium, as well as an oral presentation a week prior. I've also done a poster presentation at a regional APS meeting, and am planning to do so again later this semester.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: I'm in the executive cabinet of my university's Student Government Association.

Special Bonus Points: I've made some pretty good connections during the summers of 2015 and 2016, so that should definitely help. My research adviser seems to have a lot of connections at various universities, but I'm not 100% sure where.

Lessons Learned:

I think this'll be my last edit on my applicant profile, unless I can think of anything helpful to add later. All in all, I'd say that this was a very successful application season for me. My general strategy was along the lines of "throw a lot of darts at the dartboard, and some are sure to stick," but things definitely went better than I had expected. For people applying to PhD programs in the future, here are some lessons I've learned over the past few months.

1. The thing that I think helped me out the most was my research experience. I started doing undergraduate research my sophomore year, both at my home institution and at other institutions. If you haven't started doing research yet, I'd recommend doing so as soon as possible. Not only does it build your physics background, but the relationships you form with your advisers will allow them to write extremely insightful and well-crafted letters of recommendation.

2. Be prepared to potentially spend a ton of money. Between taking the pGRE thrice, the general GRE once, and all the application fees, I spent just shy of $2,000 (I was keeping a spreadsheet of expenses). This is one thing that I wish I knew going into the process.

3. Conquering the Physics GRE is a major asset. It helped me improve my pGRE score from a 660 to 820. Not perfect by any means, but still a step in the right direction.

4. The grad school application process was a very stressful time for me, and I'm sure it is for many others as well. So just be sure to balance everything you do. Make sure you take a step back from your applications and schoolwork to just unwind. For me, my "escape" was hiking. Just do whatever you enjoy to help keep a healthy, clear mind!

Undergrad Institution: Large liberal arts school in Boston, not a great reputation in physics but has a few professors doing good condensed matter research
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): Math
GPA in Major: 3.1
Overall GPA: 3.0
Length of Degree: 4
Position in Class: average
Type of Student: domestic hispanic male

GRE Scores : (revised)
Q: 166 (91%)
V: 166 (97%)
W: 5 (93%)
P: 820 (74%) (Up from a 620 (33%) 2 years ago, so I'm pretty happy about this)


Research Experience: During college: 0.5 years in a condensed matter lab at undergrad institution working on the development of novel thermoelectric materials. 1.5 years in another condensed matter lab working on plasmonics in nanostructures, led to a poster at a New England APS meeting and a Senior Honors Thesis.

After College: I've been working full time for the past 1.5 years in a radiology lab at an Ivy League school working on hyperpolarized MRI. So far I have one 1st Author paper in a medical physics journal as well as 2 co-authorships on other papers, Im hoping to get another 1st author paper out in the next month or two before applications go out. I've also had 3 posters and one talk at international conferences, I'll have submitted 2-3 more abstracts for posters/talks by the time applications go out but wont hear back about them until ~February. Also had a handful of posters at internal conferences but I figure those don't count for much.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Not much, 2 undergraduate research fellowships (just an award to get research funded), and a couple of semesters on the dean's list

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Currently volunteering as a TA for an introductory physics class for post-bacc students.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: None that I can think of

Special Bonus Points: Should have 3 pretty good letters, Hoping that having >1 year experience working full time as a researcher will give me a bit of a boost.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: N/A

Notes: Applied to 12 schools, got into 2. Main thing that held me back was obviously my undergraduate grades, but I was able to salvage my chances with 2 years of postgrad research and a couple of publications. If I were to go through all this again I would have applied to less extreme-reach schools and applied to more second/third tier schools to give me some more options. In the end I'm extremely happy that I at least got one good acceptance at a school that has several faculty matching my research interest.

V: 156 (72%)
W: 4.0 (59%)
P: 820 (74%)


Research Experience:
3 years of research in computational astrophysics at current school that will accumulate into a paper by the end of the year (hopefully by the end of this semester if I don't get too bogged down with graduate school applications). This research was funded over a summer by an awarded space grant and has led to two poster presentations. Last summer I interned at a national lab in high energy density physics (HEDP). That research has accumulated in a paper that is currently in review.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Dean's List, local scholarships

Undergrad Institution: French public university, with a rather good reputation in physics.
Major(s): Bs. in Physics, Ms. in Physics and Materials
GPA in Major: ca. 85% in bachelor, 80% in master
Overall GPA: 90% in bachelor, 80% in master
Length of Degree: 3 yr Bsc. + 2 yr Msc.
Position in Class: Top
Type of Student: International male, not minority.

GRE Scores : revised
Q: 166 (91%)
V: 161 (87%)
W: 3.5 (40%) (was tempted to retake but well).
P: 810 (72%)

TOEFL Total: 110 (but only 22 in speaking, which is sometimes below requirements. I contacted the programs and made sure this would not be a problem before applying, turns out those minima aren't that strict in general ... ;) )

Research Experience: 3 summer internships including one abroad. The two most recent are in my field of research.
I mentionned in SOP that my 5 months long master thesis will take place during next spring, and is traditionally when European students sign their first publication(s).

Awards/Honors/Recognitions:
Got various scolarships to study abroad, once each from French Embassies in USA and Belgium and twice from EU.
Graduated with high honors from my bachelor and high school.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs:
Animated a workshop about physics in a primary school;
Taught personal lessons in mathematics to high school students (I mention my interest in teaching in my SOP);

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:
Got involved in the creation of a FabLab at my home institution ;

Special Bonus Points:
One of my recommender had me for three different classes at a graduate level and knows me very well. Another was the internship supervisor I got along best with. The last one has known me for 2 years. I expect very positive recommendations from all of them.

Very specific research interests that I have been consistent with through my education, such that my elective courses and internships are quite adapted to the kind of research I am applying to.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:
1 semester abroad during bachelor at UCONN and 1 year abroad during master at UAntwerpen.
Research interest is really at the boundary between physics, chemistry, MSE and EE, and I happened to have worked with people from each of those background, so I mention this in my SOP hoping that counts.

I specifically mention the professors I want to work with in my statements.

Applying to Where:

Requires or recommends PGRE
Boston University - Physics - Computational physics applied to solar cells 04/10 - Rejected by e-mail.
Harvard - Chemistry- Solar cells understanding - 01/30 - Rejected by e-mail to check website.. Retrospectively, I could have expected it and spare me the trouble of applying.
MIT - Physics- Photonics - Rejected by e-mail to check website. Can't find the e-mail of rejection now.
Northwestern University - Applied Physics - Solar cells understanding - 01/26 Invited to send a video of introduction as part of the next stage of application. then waitlisted for several months 04/17 Rejected by e-mail, asking not to ask for details given the number of applicants. This was the most difficult to receive, because I feel like I was really standing a chance, also the incertitude of being waitlisted for several months is unbearable!

No subject test asked
CMU - MSE - Computational physics applied to solar cells - 03/9 Rejected by e-mail to check website they replied very kindly to my e-mail asking for what were the main flaws of my application, which softened the blow. :-)
MIT - MSE - Solar cells fabrication - 12/02 IELTS waiver request rejected One has to pay the application fee just to know weither the IELTS waiver will be granted or not. They gave me a new deadline to send scores, but it was impossible to meet since all upcoming test taking dates were already booked. Well, I tried.
UMich Ann Arbor - MSE - Solar cells fabrication - 04/11 Rejected by e-mail.

Reflexion a posteriori on my application
I was aware that I was applying to strong programs with many applicants, but I know that I still have my chances in Europe therefore I am not worried. If I had to do it again, perhaps I would not consider MIT and Harvard: they were essentially out of reach and made me loose a lot of time in perfecting my letters. Particularly disappointing was the way some programs kept me waiting without any indication: I had to ask about my status to know that I was waitlisted and the number of waitlisted students or positions remaining was never communicated.

Overall, I really disliked this experience full of stress. The principle of applying to a phd program rather than a phd project was very confusing and gives the impression of being very small in a gigantic crowd of applicants. All the places I am applying to in Europe were civil enough to let me know how many applicants are being considered, what my status is and to invite me for interviews less than a month after the first contact.

The unexpected positive experince was the PGRE: sure it's a pain, but once I read "Conquering the PGRE " and made myself sheets of formulas, it became so much easier to work on it (I had taken it two years before) and also quite valuable to have all the electromagnetism formulas refreshed in mind. So, to all international applicants out there: do embrace this test. In spite of its many flaws it is a very effective recap of everything you know.

P: 920 (87th %)
It's a literal miracle that I did so well on the PGRE. My advice is to take as many of the official practice tests as possible but focus on the newer versions. And Conquering the Physics GRE by Kahn/Anderson is a lifesaver.

Research Experience:
Three and a half years working with a professor at my school in the Auger Collaboration on ultra high energy cosmic rays. 3 conference talks, one collaboration meeting, senior thesis in the works
One semester working on Auger when I studied abroad in Spain
One and a half years working in the LIGO stochastic group. I started through an International REU in Australia and then an REU at Caltech. One short author list and 2 full collaboration list papers in the works

Well connected in LIGO with a recommendation letter from a very well-known collaboration member
Female and first generation American

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:
Not sure how my Spanish double major and Violin performance minor will factor into things, if at all

****************
Reflections: The whole grad school admissions process has made this the most stressful year of undergrad for me because both applying in the fall and visiting places in the Spring is very time consuming. Listen to your advisors when they give you advice about which schools and how many to apply to, because I could have saved myself some hassle and some money in application fees. The PGRE can be very daunting, but if you actually put in the time to study effectively, you can do well. My score improved by ~200 points from the first time I took it. The fellowship application process can also be very rewarding, and sometimes you get lucky and things work out! If you're thinking about taking a year off for research or a masters abroad, go for it! School are very open to allowing deferrals for circumstances like this.

Undergrad Institution: Caltech
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): Computer Science
GPA in Major:3.4
Overall GPA:3.5 (:/ but my school is reasonably well known for grade deflation. We'll see how much this hurts.)
Length of Degree:4 years
Position in Class: Not tracked, but probably upper interquartile by GPA (IIRC average physics GPA is 3.4)
Type of Student: Domestic male

GRE Scores : revised
Q: 170 (97%)
V: 167 (98%)
W: 4.5 (82%)
P: 970 (93%)
My score jumped up almost 200 points (from first attempt, with no studying) from about a week of semi-intensive studying right before taking the test. Just memorize/cache as much stuff as you can and it'll probably improve your score by at least 100 points. Conquering the physics gre is a good resource, but the practice tests aren't great or similar to the actual PGRE. I would recommend using every available past PGRE test and making flashcards for random things you can memorize.

Research Experience:
Two first-author publications, one scientific software development project with a repository I can link to:

    1 year geophysics research with well-known mentor, resulted in poster presentation at AGU and a first author publication in Geophysical Research Letters.
    1 summer particle physics with well-known mentor, resulted in first author CMS analysis note (not quite same level as a journal article, but hopefully it helps).
    1 summer software development for SLAC, technical repository I can link to but no publication.


Awards/Honors/Recognitions:
Undergraduate research award
A few awards/honors from high school that are sufficiently prestigious that I'll include them (Davidson, ISEF, JSHS)
Didn't think to apply to a lot of scholarships, missed the boat on Goldwater :/

Pertinent Activities or Jobs:
Tutor for basically every class.
TA for an introductory CS class.

Special Bonus Points:
Two recommendations from very well-known professors in their respective fields.
Minority points - LGBT
Lots of graduate physics and CS classes, including a quantum computing course that is well known (linked to a lot by other courses).

Applying to Where:

Stanford - Applied physics, Quantum information - Accepted by email from dept. chair 2/5, $38,000/yr research position, no TAing required. WILL ATTEND!
UC Berkeley - Physics, Quantum information - They literally never got back with me, after emailing them twice.
MIT - Physics, Quantum information - Rejected by website (no email notification) 2/15 (bish you weren't my first choice anyway)
Harvard - Physics, Quantum information - Rejected by email
Princeton - Physics, Quantum information - Rejected by email
Yale - Physics, Quantum information - Rejected by email
Columbia - Physics, Quantum information - Rejected by email
UCSD - Physics, Quantum information - Accepted by email 1/30
UCSB - Physics, Quantum information - Accepted by email 1/31, "at least" $30,000 TA stipend
UChicago - Physics, Quantum information - Accepted by phone call from potential PI on 1/31, offer forthcoming
UColorado Boulder - Physics, Quantum information - Accepted by email 2/5, $34,000 TA stipend + $10,000 "signing bonus"

Pertinent Activities or Jobs:
worked in a nuclear physics lab as hourly for 2 years
worked as a TA for a year at UW
currently spending my gap year working for NASA on exoplanet research

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

Special Bonus Points:
I know like fifty physics pun

I found out after the fact that the adviser to my research adviser (at UW) was on the admissions council at Stanford, and it is plausible that this put my research experience in a particularly favorable light. Additionally, my 3 recommenders had alma maters at (Stanford, UCSB, and Berkeley) two of which I got into, so it is also plausible that this helped.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:
I applied to, Stanford, Berkeley, Princeton, UMD, UC boulder, UCSB, Chicago last year and was rejected from all of them, I had an 840 PGRE that year, and has 1 year less experience at NASA, and didn't have my second or third research experience at UW, didn't have my conference presentation eitehr, had not actually graduated etc. Last year I also was applying to PT exclusively. Anyway hopefully my app is stronger this year

Applying to Where:

Princeton - PHYS - HEPEx rejected 2/16, email
Harvard - PHYS - not specified rejected 2/16, email
Stanford - PHYS - HEPEx accepted 2/10, email
Berkeley - PHYS - HEPEx rejected 3/08, email
UCSB - PHYS - HEPEx accepted 2/03, email to check website
UC Boulder - PHYS - thoery generic rejected 3/03, email
Chicago - PHYS - HEP generic rejected 2/17, email
Maryland - PHYS - Experiment generic waitlisted 2/10
Cornell - PHYS - not specified rejected 2/17, email
Caltech - PHYS - Cos-Ex accepted 2/15, email

Reflections:

Wow what a roll, the schools I got into versus not getting into is really interesting. For instance both Stanford and Caltech but not Maryland or Colorado. I definitely would not have predicted this. Overall I am pretty pleased, I got into 2 out of my top 3 choices. Maybe this is indicative of schools actually considering a good "fit" and not just test scores. I was very specific about projects I wanted to work on so this could also have helped/hurt.

This cycle was a reapplication (last year I only got into my alma matter, UW). I had a better pgre by 120 pts, an additional year of research experience at NASA and UW, a slightly higher GPA, and also demonstrated competence in upper level physics classes. I also changed my research intent from HEP-T to HEP-Ex (although I stated in my letter that I am undecided on theory vs experiment, which is true). My reccommenders also had had more research experience with me and presumably knew me better this round and had more nice things to say. It is very difficult to say what factor contributed to more success this round as I tried to cover all of my bases. However, what is evident is that taking a gap year and reapplying is not entirely pointless (I moved up from a top 20ish school with UW to a top 5ish school with Caltech or Stanford; and got rid of the incest stigma of attending the same undergrad as grad school).

At this point, I am torn between attending Caltech and Stanford, they both seem like excellent schools. I am leaning towards Stanford because they allow you to rotate through research groups your first year while Caltech seems to want you to start in a group immediately which isn't very conducive to being torn between several interests as I am. If you have any questions about my application or decision processes please feel free to message me.

Undergrad Institution: Large State School, Top 15 in Physics
Major(s): Physics (was a double major with Aerospace Engineering for 3 years before dropping after last semester)
Minor(s):
GPA in Major: 4.00
Overall GPA: 3.97
Length of Degree: 4
Position in Class: Top or close to it (school doesn't rank)
Type of Student: Domestic White Male

GRE Scores :
Q: 167 (93%)
V: 158 (80%)
W: 4.0 (59%)
P: 840 (77%)


Research Experience: I have done quite a lot of research, but no publications. Honors program for my university that involved a 3 year group research project in magnetostatics. Resulted in a poster and an oral presentation at undergraduate research events at my university. 6 months for a near space science group that performed experiments in weather balloons at high altitudes. Summer research in nonlinear dynamics that resulted in an undergraduate research presentation. 1 year of research on data analysis for a cosmic ray detector that is about to be operational. Resulted in a presentation at a the cosmic ray group's biannual conference. 1 year of work on numerical relativity simulations of gravitational wave simulations. This started shortly before LIGO detected gravitational waves. I am presenting my research at the APS April 2017 Conference (which is January for some reason :? ). 2 months of work on developing data analysis techniques for the upcoming NICER mission to study neutron stars using X-rays.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Presidential Scholarship, Dean's List every semester, multiple honors societies

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Tutored physics for 1.5 years

Special Bonus Points: I am currently taking grad classes. In addition, this will be the first round of grad school apps since LIGO and I am applying to do research in numerical relativity. I am hoping schools will be looking for people in fields such mine related to gravitational wave physics.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I got a lot of A+'s on my transcript which give the same gpa as an A despite being much harder to get. I also have a lot of technical courses on my transcript.

Applying to Where: All Numerical Relativity

University of Toronto -Astronomy and Astrophysics-Rejected 4/13 via email


Fellowships Applied :
NSFGRFP-Rejected

All in all, I am happy about how things went. It ended up as a really close choice between UIUC and RIT, but I decided to go with UIUC in the end because there will be better opportunities to build connections outside my field. If I had to do the process over again, I would have applied to less reach schools and more lower ranked schools specializing in numerical relativity such as Wisconsin, Penn St, and LSU (especially for the free visits :D). Also, I should have tried to gear my personal statement for experimental gravitational wave physics forplaces where they have a lot of that going on like Caltech to lower PGRE thresholds. I hope my experience will help others through this process.

This is for all you future domestic white male theory applicants out there trying to gauge how tough admissions are. Best of luck!

Undergrad Institution: Decent private school, not an especially strong reputation for physics
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): Math, Electrical Engineering
GPA in Major: 3.94
Overall GPA: 3.91
Length of Degree: 4
Position in Class: Presumably near the top - does anywhere actually post class position?
Type of Student: Domestic white male

GRE Scores :
Q: 169 (97%)
V: 158 (80%)
W: 3.0 (17%) :wink:
P: 910 (86%)


Research Experience:
~2 years electrical engineering/applied physics/materials research -> 4 publications (ranging from 3rd to 5th author), conference poster presentation,
1 REU in nuclear theory (good amount of QFT) -> paper in preparation

Awards/Honors/Recognitions:
Honors society stuff, nothing that sticks out

Pertinent Activities or Jobs:

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

Special Bonus Points:
Graduate courses: Quantum 1-2, Quantum Field Theory, Solid States

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:
Late switch from engineering to physics

Applying to Where:
All high energy theory (hep-th), particle cosmology and phenomenology

In rough descending order of hopelessness:
MIT - Rejected (2/10)
Harvard - Rejected (2/16)
Princeton - Rejected (2/16)
Stanford - Rejected (2/10)
Caltech - Rejected (2/24)
Berkeley - Rejected (3/9)
Cornell - Rejected (2/17)
Chicago - Rejected (2/17)
UCSB - Rejected (2/24)
Penn
UW-Madison - Accepted! (1/24)
Michigan - Rejected (2/10)
UW-Seattle - Accepted! (1/23)
JHU
SUNY-Stony Brook - Accepted! (1/28)
Rutgers - Accepted! (2/22)
NYU - Waitlisted (2/27) - NYU's weird.. they are only willing to accept "top students" if they give them full fellowship funding. This is why they have so many waitlisted people - there are only a couple of fellowship spots available but a lot of "top students".

Well, there you have it. Not only do I get to spend the next 4-5 years of my life thinking about physics all day, but I'm getting PAID to do it! HEP-th is getting increasingly competitive, and this year especially, it seemed there were very few spots everywhere. Perhaps there were a few areas where I could have made my application marginally stronger and gotten into more "prestigious" schools, but it's a crapshoot for pretty much everyone, and I was fortunate enough to have acceptances to some fantastic programs. So for future theory applicants, if a big name school is your goal you will probably end up disappointed, but there are many more places you can do great physics. Don't be deterred by all of the people whining on the internet about not getting into Stanford et. al. - if you're dead-set on high energy theory, and you cast a wide application net and work your @$$ off, you'll do fine.

W: 4.0 (59%)
P: 780 (67%)


TOEFL Total: 116 (IBT)

Research Experience: Undergradaute research since my freshman year on thermal characterization and data acquisition systems. Summer research internship on AMO. Senior thesis on X-ray diffraction. After graduating, I remained at my home university during a year doing research in X-ray. One first author paper, several poster presentations and seminars.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Summa cum laude, my summer internship was in Canada and I received a full fellowship for it (:

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: I have been a TA for 3 elementary Physics classes, 1 Microscopy elective class, and 3 Adv. Experimental Physics Labs. My current job at my home university is a mixture of being a TA+RA.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

Special Bonus Points: I did a study abroad program in the US during my junior year. I was able to take several graduate classes, particularly one in AMO Physics. Also, I freelance as a science graphic designer , i.e. I do graphical abstracts and diagrams for papers (that is quite random, but it might help)

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I have a professional webpage with my portfolio and detailed info about my experience (research, work, etc).

Applying to Where: All in AMO experimental Physics

RICE - AMO Physics - ACCEPTED! (12/21) - ~$30k + extra fellowship + external aid fellowship !
Stanford - AMO Physics - REJECTED! (02/10) -
Colorado Boulder - AMO Physics REJECTED! (03/03) -
UC Berkeley - AMO Physics - REJECTED! (03/08) -
UIUC - AMO Physics - REJECTED! (03/10) -

12/21/2016: The RICE acceptance letter was a really nice, early Christmas gift though!

03/14/2017:
Well, admission season is FINALLY over! What a stressful time it was ...

It seems like my application bombed on every university but RICE. I didn't expect much from Stanford or Boulder because they never answered my emails, but a professor in Berkeley told me that my profile was good. Not good enough I guess!

I got a really nice fellowship, and RICE is top ranked in AMO, so things went really good anyways! For any AMO guy/gal in the future, check RICE! They even accept you early and don't have to suffer the seemingly eternal wait for decisions.

Undergrad Institution: top 20 private research university, little reputation for physics
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): none
GPA in Major: 3.62
Overall GPA: 3.53
Length of Degree: 4
Position in Class: ~75th percentile is my guess
Type of Student: domestic white male

GRE Scores : revised
Q: 170 (97 %ile)
V: 168 (98 %ile)
W: 5.5 (98 %ile)
P: 990 (94 %ile)

regarding the PGRE: the conquering the physics GRE book is amazing. 1 year ago I took the test and got in the 28th percentile. If you are willing to put in some serious study time and make a poop load of flashcards, this test can be dominated. Also helps to have good standardized test skills (which, because of my job, I have).


Research Experience: yearlong fellowship during which I designed numerical methods to test for physics beyond standard model using astrophysical photons.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Cum Laude, dean's list two semester

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: I am currently a math, physics, and test prep tutor. Have been a substitute teacher for years. Also do volunteer tutoring.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: I graduated on time and completed my honors thesis in spite of a serious head injury that forced me to withdraw for first semester of my senior year.

Special Bonus Points: I don't think much. I got a 990 on the PGRE after being out of school for three years but I don't think they'll care much about that beyond the fact that the score is good and recent. My research advisor is writing a great rec. A friend of a family friend is director of graduate studies in physics at yale.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: one disciplinary action taken at undergrad, some schools have asked about this. marked these with a D.

Applying to Where: (in descending order of US News rank)

Rejected
Waitlisted
Accepted
Withdrawn

MIT app 12/15 - WILL ATTEND Condensed Matter / Astrophysics (spoke with two professors, one hinted he might pull strings, the other I did not impress) - accepted 2/9 via email. 36K research assistantship. i'm dyinggggg. going to withdraw from a couple places (probably yale,brown, bu, northwestern)
Harvard app 12/15- Condensed Matter (spoke with one professor)
Berkeley D app 12/16- Condensed Matter - 32 K TA ship
Caltech app 12/15- Condensed Matter
Stanford D app 12/13- Condensed Matter - rejected 2/10 email
U of I - Condensed Matter - rejected 4/1 email
Columbia D - Condensed Matter (spoke with one professor and we really hit it off. this is where I want to go in my heart of hearts) - rejected 3/16 email
Yale D - Condensed Matter - rejected 3/6 email to check website. I don't know how but I knew it.
UMD D app 12/15 - Condensed Matter - rejected 2/10 email
Johns Hopkins app 12/15- Condensed Matter - accepted via email feb 8. My first acceptance!!!
Northwestern - Condensed Matter (spoke with one professor and he is a friggin weirdo) - withdrawn... and then rejected on April 19?
Brown - Condensed Matter (meeting with one professor) - withdrawn
BU - Condensed Matter - withdrawn

Interested in both Exp and Th but I am especially interested in ab initio methods so the faculty preferences lean a little bit toward Th.

I'm including predictions because I want to see how good my intuition is.
My grades are good but not very impressive so I have covered the competitiveness spectrum I think. Of the MIT, Harvard, Berkeley, Caltech, Stanford, and U of I contingent (the tippy top schools) I predict I will get into 0-1 with MIT (correct) actually being the most likely to admit followed by Berkeley (correct). I only predict MIT because I think this one astro professor is really interested in me. Berkeley is next because of the size of the admitted class and my second essay for them was very good. I think next most likely is U of I.

I predict Columbia is 60/40 accept and Yale will reject me almost certainly (in spite of family connection). I don't know why but I have this feeling Yale won't buy what I'm selling (correct).
I predict UMD will accept (I am MD in state) (incorrect) and I predict acceptance at 2/4 of Hopkins, Northwestern, Brown, BU (untested).

In total, anywhere between 3 and 6 acceptances would not surprise me.

I think it is unlikely but not impossible I get in nowhere. I'd give this a 5-10% chance of happening. Hope I don't eat my words.

closing thoughts: I am deliriously happy. Hopkins is great but I will be deciding between Berkeley and MIT. I think my best advice for future students is to get started in research early and really really work at talking to professors at schools. I am quite sure I got into MIT because I spoke with a professor there. Also, apply to the top 5 schools if at all possible even if they are a longshot. The money of applying is short term pain but getting into one of those places sets up connections that last a career ( or so I think. which may be bad advice).

I ended up choosing MIT! I'll do astro for a while there and if I like it, stick with it (but probably transfer to CM). I'm super excited but jesus that was hard. I have cried tears of confusion so many times. Berkeley is amazing. I hope I get to go there some day.

Additional Comments: This thread caused me a lot of anxiety over the past year but I think in the end it helped me a ton in deciding what schools were realistic for my profile. We will see. Good luck everyone and congrats on getting these god-forsaken apps done! You would think with all the great minds in physics we could standardize the application process a bit. Haha. It's ridiculous.

(After the process is over) Comments: I am really excited about the research at UW. It's a pretty great place for experimental nuclear. Seattle should be great. Now off to 7 weeks in Nepal!! Good luck everyone.

    A bunch of outreach


Special Bonus Points:

    I have a bachelor's degree in the arts (physics is my second bachelor's degree)
    One of my recommenders is fairly well known in my goal field (astrophysics) and has a lot of connections with schools, NASA
    Am a non-traditional student

Applying to Where:

My research interest: exo/planetary science, data science, climate science. The schools are listed in approximate order from top picks to last picks, but the latter 6 are kind of fluid. The top 4 are pretty definite in order.

Accepted Waitlisted Rejected

University of Colorado Boulder - Astrophysics & Planetary Sciences - WILL ATTEND! Funding: ~$31,700 TA/RA including summer positions*. Accepted! 27 January 2017, by email

University of Washington - Astronomy - Rejected by email 3 March 2017
University of Arizona - Astronomy - Rejected by email 27 January 2017
Northern Arizona University - Physics & Astrophysics - Declined - and it was hard. NAU people and department were wonderful. Accepted! 2 February 2017, by email, $26,000/year via TA/RA
Cornell - Astronomy - Waitlisted, 9 February 2017, notice by email
University of California Santa Cruz - Astronomy - Rejected by email 13 February 2017
MIT - Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences - Rejected 27 February 2017 by email
University of British Columbia - Physics & Astrophysics (Master's program) - Declined Accepted! 13 January 2017, by phonecall; base $21,662 (TA/RA) (BEFORE tuition and fees--net was about CAD $17,000)
Northwestern University - Physics & Astrophysics
University of Texas Austin - Astronomy - Rejected by email 29 March 2017

Also applied:

NSF GRFP - Rejected by email 17 March 2017

That's it--I'll update the list with rejections and (hopefully) acceptances!

* There was some weirdness with Boulder APS being really noncommittal about the amount -- we were told it would be sent by mail, then in the mail it said we'd find out at the visit. At the visit, everyone I talked to (faculty, grad students) gave similar numbers between $30,000 and $40,000 a year. We strongly voiced our concern with the department not putting it in writing and we finally got something from admin stating that this year's package was ~$31,700 with summer work (not guaranteed, but everyone does it) and that it would "almost never decrease."

Undergrad Institution:Middle of nowhere
Major(s): Physics
GPA in Major: 3.2
Overall GPA: 3.2
Length of Degree: 5 years
Position in Class: I think it's average
Type of Student: Domestic, male

GRE Scores :
Q: 162 (82%) :?

(5) and a few minor course projects

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Nothing special

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Organizer of a science program in my university

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: two talks in weekly seminars

Special Bonus Points: strong letters(I hope :roll: ) and strong researches in my interests

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I had a terrible start :x and a bad GPA but in the middle of my studies I tried hard to cover my mistakes, my last 60 credits GPA is 3.7, I got A and A+ marks in all courses which are related to my interests (including a PhD level course), good knowledge of programming and simulation, I hope admission committees consider these points and forgive me for my bad grades in the first half of my studies. :cry:

Applying to Where:

Pending-Accepted- Waitlisted - Rejected

in order of my preference:

Michigan - Physics- REJECTED Feb 5 :x
Edinburgh - Physics- Complex Systems- REJECTED 3/13
Neils Bohr institute - Physics- BioMed- ACCEPTED! for MA 3/6 no funding
McGill - Physics- interviewed 3/8-ACCEPTED! for MA 5/9+ 24 k ,Will ATTEND!! finally! :D
Stuttgart - Physics- ACCEPTED! for MA 4/1
Ohio State - Physics- ACCEPTED! 2/26
Northeastern - Physics- REJECTED 2/24 kidding me?!
Brown - Physics- REJECTED 2/23 offered Master degree with no funding
Emory - Physics- Statistical Physics- invited for interview 2/5-ACCEPTED! 2/16- 25K/yr +tuition coverage
UMass - Physics- REJECTED 4/15
Calgary - Physics- Complex Systems- invited for interview 2/14 - ACCEPTED! for MA 2/18 + 25K/yr + 5K

Scholarships:

IMPRS nope!!
SUPA prize--> rejected from Edinburgh University so nothing.


Update on 2/24 : well I really didn't expect a rejection from Northeastern considering my own research background and their research areas. I was ready for Brown, my GPA had its influence on my application (a rejection from UMass can prove this, lets see what will happen!). So even universities like Brown which pay attention to your research can get disappointed by looking at your low GPA. However, everything in process of applying is just so chaotic. At the best situation with the best GPA and research background, your chance is 50/50.

Update on 4/1: Wow! Acceptance from Stuttgart was so surprising, waiting for financial support. I messed up on the interview with a supervisor in McGill. Not familiar with his type of research, although I may have some chances with another one.

Update on 5/9 : Well, it is finished, I got McGill and definitely I cannot believe this!! For everybody who is applying in the future, if you have a good research background and you GPA is poor, try to apply for few dream schools, it worth it! As I said At the best situation with the best GPA and research background, your chance is 50/50. Best wishes for all. Glade to find this great website. :wink:

Hints: Do research! apply according your research background,take interviews much more seriously and for practice speak loudly to yourselves

Applying to Where: All Physics or Applied Physics, interested in condensed matter and magnetism research. List was primarily built around schools with multiple researchers in my area of interest, connections to national labs doing magnetism research where possible, and places I thought I had a shot given my not-so-great GPA.

FSU - Accepted 2/16 with TAship plus $1000 Dean's scholars ship plus $3000 fellowship. $700 to cover a visit, but from the west coast that does not cover it. VIsit wasn't super -- nice equipment, but not my tribe.
Rutgers - Emailed for update on 3/17, they responded and said they have made 2 waves of offers and are "working on developing their waitlist". They posted rejection on the website on 4/14.
University of Connecticut - Accepted 2/10 with email saying check the website. TA/funding info came a couple days later. Visited UConn, gotta say. Their travel reimbursement process is a nightmare. You have to register as a vendor, provide a W9, etc. Just to get your airfare back.
Iowa State - Accepted via email 2/1 with 9 month TA offer and paid visit. No interview, they asked for 1st semester grades a couple of weeks ago. Surprisingly great visit, Attending!!
Colorado School of Mines - Received email on 1/24 with invitation for phone interview, then nothing until denial posted on website on 4/14.
Colorado State - Accepted via email 1/31, 9 month TA position. No interview prior to acceptance. Visit offered. Declined, not visiting.
UColorado - Colorado Springs - Accepted via email on 2/8, declined when visits started stacking up

Visited, offered an RA spot while there. They asked for answer by March 10 (even though they are part of the group that isn't supposed to get answers til April 15).
Oregon State - Received email on 2/7 with invitation to visit 2/24 or cost covered for visit on a different date. Followed by acceptance on 2/8.
Northern Illinois University - Didn't hear anything by March 11, withdrew application
Miami University (Masters) - Didn't hear anything by March 11, withdrew application

Notes on the process that I wish I had read 2-years-ago: I had applied for a PhD to a similar list of schools two years ago, when I finished my undergrad and got straight rejections (13 of them, to be exact). I wanted to write about my experience, because I know how tough and discouraging it is to have rejections. Luckily, I did not give up, got into an MSc in Physics in my home country, and got accepted to some pretty decent programs (Irvine had rejected me the first time around and I turned that into an acceptance now! :) Yay! :) ) Thinking back, I think the most important two things that I had done was increase my PGRE score from 660 to 830 (not amazing, I know, but it took a lot of work for me to get there and I'm proud of it :)), and improve my research experience significantly. In fact, I applied with exactly the same GRE General Score as before and other than my age the only things that changed in my applications were the PGRE, research, and grad courses I took in my master's. I can't speak for all admissions committees, but it seems that to meta-secure chances of admission in an above 50-70 ranked school, a good PGRE score (above 70%) is really important. Research experience in the relevant field is most crucial as well. I had plenty of research experience in good institutions in biophysics (as well as some in astrophysics) on my first round of applications, and that got me nowhere. In my master's, I focused on my area of choice in astrophysics (compact objects) and made a poster presentation and had two papers in preparation (one as first author) when I applied, I think those really helped too. If you have the chance, I'd suggest taking graduate courses also. When I had asked a UC school why I wasn't admitted 2 years ago, they told me it was because the classes I have taken weren't enough (I was doing a double major in my bachelor's so I had not taken any additional grad courses.). Oh, and try to apply to as many places as you can, if you can afford it, and make sure to have some *safety* choices that suits you, you never know what's going to happen with this process, even people with perfect scores and perfect research get rejected sometimes.

This is not to say that a lower PGRE score or no publications will not get you anywhere. Unfortunately, there is no perfect recipe to get into a specific school. If you have the time before applications when you are reading this, I'd make the time to study for the PGRE seriously, I really regret underestimating the exam 2 years ago. And if you did not get accepted to your dream school, a master's is a great step between your dreams and you current self, so give that a chance. I was really sad to start my master's here, but I'm very appreciative of the opportunities it has given me and how much it helped me improve. Overall, this is a tough process, and it takes serious work. There will be bumps on the road (I almost could not take the PGRE this year because they decided not to offer it in my country and I had trouble paying for a visa and to travel abroad to take the exam, for example.) This is only to say that if you really want it, don't let it go, it will happen if you try hard enough! :)

Good luck!

I like the fact that I received rejections, because it meant that I put myself out there, but the sheer number means I might have been reaching too far considering my low GPA; I was thinking my ok GRE score made up for it. Definitely lucky I was able to find a place at a good school among the (few) acceptances I received, so I don't have to go through this process again.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Varsity athlete, awards for all-academic team (basically meaningless)

Special Bonus Points: I'm a likeable guy, hopefully decent recs

Applying to Where:

Harvard - Physics - CMT/AMOT - Rejected, 2/16
Caltech - Physics - Quantum Information - Rejected, 2/24
Yale - Physics - Quantum Information - Rejected, 3/6
Boulder - Physics - AMOT - Accepted 2/3, Funding 29k/34k for TA/RA, 6k signing bonus, partial health
Stony Brook - Physics - AMOT - Unofficial Acceptance 2/10, formal offer to follow
Michigan - Physics - AMOT - Rejected, 2/10
Boston - Physics - CMT/AMOT
University of Washington - Physics - AMOE - Accepted 1/30, TAship 2,228/month +health insurance
Northwestern - Physics - CMT/AMOT - Accepted 1/25, Funding 30k + health insurance
NYU - Physics - AMOT - Unofficial Acceptance 2/8, 4 years full funding - declined 3/13
UCSD - Physics - AMOE - Accepted 2/2, no word on funding - declined 3/13

Notes: I was talking with a PI from UW before being accepted and he mentioned to me that they go through the applications, at least for this round, alphabetically, and accept as they read. Therefore for future applicants with late in the alphabet last names (my last name begins with W) don't panic if you start seeing UW acceptances and you haven't heard anything.
Update on 2/10: Things have been going pretty well by this point, with 6/6 acceptances. While I haven't heard from the big 3 I applied to, I would say this is a pretty good haul. To future applicants out there with semi-garbage pGRE scores (with respect to theory), know that all is not lost. My statement of purpose also was nothing special, just recounted my past research, and mentioned a professor or two I wanted to work with in the specific department. What must have done it was my recommendations - I had a very strong relationship with my research adviser, working with him for three years and publishing a paper together. And for my other two recommenders, I had had 2 classes with each of them, and TAed a class for both of them. They believed in me and my ability to succeed at the next level, and I truly believe that's what pushed me over the edge at a lot of these places. So the point is, work hard to develop relationships with your professors, and know that if you put work in for them, they will for you.
Update, later on 2/10: I got too cocky! First rejection just hours after my schpiel!

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Three co-authored papers, 12 presentations (mostly poster) at different research conferences

Special Bonus Points: Presented at AAS twice and did some schmoozing with grad schools. I'm a real charmer.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:

Caltech - Geo/planetary
Berkeley -
UCLA -
Boulder -
Penn State -
Santa Cruz -
Washington -
Michigan -
Hawaii -
UT Austin -

UPDATE: Rejected from all.

Reflections: No matter how competitive faculty/advisors say your application is, always apply to easy safety schools too. I made the mistake of applying to only top schools and got rejected from every single one, even though my application was very competitive. I am fortunate enough to have job offers from three different institutions to do more research in my gap year, so remember connections are important!!! I'll see you all next year for round two 8)

Well, there ya go. I've been a lurker on this site for years and it feels good to finally fuel someone else's anxiety.

I guess it's my turn... good luck & best of wishes to everyone.
-----
Undergrad Institution: Top 30ish in US Undergrad. Ranking, decent physics reputation?
Major(s): Physics & Astronomy, Mathematics
Minor(s): Philosophy
GPA in Major: 4.00
Overall GPA: 3.97
Length of Degree: 4 yrs
Position in Class: No idea, probably near top, if I had to guess
Type of Student: International Asian Male

GRE Scores : (revised or old version?)
Q: 170 (97%)
V: 159 (82%)
W: 4.0 (59%) :?
P: 990 (94%)


TOEFL Total: Did not take TOEFL (degree from US)

Research Experience: 6 months at Plasma Experiment Lab (mostly engineering / lab technician work), 1+ years in observational cosmology working on the analysis of SDSS BOSS data (a publication as a second author & a poster at APS Meeting), working on a senior thesis in a theoretical topic in general relativity / cosmology, all at my undergrad institution

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Nothing really, just the standard corollaries of good GPA

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Math TA 1 year, Physics/Astronomy TA 2 years, SPS Business Manager, Peer Adviser/Mentor selected by the school

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Started cosmology research from scratch? (my school had no cosmology research at all, my adviser and I are the first ones to start), very international background, tri-lingual

Special Bonus Points: very passionate about teaching & advising, strong recommendation letters (including hep-ex & cosmology professors) overall, an extra 4th recommendation letter from a professor whom I TA'ed for (personally close, lectured instead of him while he was gone, etc.)

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I am mostly interested at the interface between particle physics & cosmology and experiment/observation & theory. Though my undergrad research experience is only in (observational & theoretical) cosmology, my SOP focused a lot on why I believe the cosmology & particle interface will be an extremely important field in the near future. Saying "I love them both!" without sounding torn and undecided but rather confident and specialized was very difficult. It probably helped significantly that my adviser for the observational cosmology project was also someone who was transitioning from traditional HEP-ex to cosmology.

Applying to Where:

Mostly experimental particle physics & observational cosmology, with some interest in phenomenology & accelerator physics

While i was going through my bachelors and masters, I knew that my GPA is gonna affect me a lot. So I thought I'll make it up with research experience by publishing. Most people told me (they still do) that its gonna count a lot. But I still remember this one prof I met at a conference in 2014 who was from CalTech. I asked him "would you consider published papers to make up for a bad GPA?". He said "if the GPA is too low, we gotta consider how can you do research when you aren't getting good grades"! I was kinda shocked hearing that.

I got my SoP read from friends and experts. I was advised against mentioning reasons for a bad GPA. Instead just talk about research.

Helpful advice came from this forum to apply to schools where I would be a good fit. So i chose universities like that. Although they aren't doing "exactly" the same research, some techniques are similar.

I donno what's gonna happen! But all the best of luck to everybody else!

Afterthoughts: Well. Its 100% rejection in two different continents for two straight years - from Europe in 2015-16 and from North America in 2016-17. I guess my so-called plan of making up for some F's in undergrad and grad studies with some publications went down the drain :( Particularly sad about NAU. A prof whom I know recommended my name and I spent just about 20$ shy of 500$ for the application procedure including a credential evaluation. Its just absolutely WTF!! What I am unable to understand is, just how much more has to be done to be a competitive applicant?? I have an aptitude for research; this kind of thing where a problem has to be formulated, observations have to be planned, rigorous physics and intensive analysis has to be done, and results have to be written up and published, is precisely the kind of game that I've played for the last 3 years and its precisely the kind of game one has to play during Ph.D.. YTF can't it be recognized and opportunities (however small) be given??

Undergrad Institution: Big state school, top 20 physics

Major(s): Physics
GPA in Major: 3.3 ish? Not impressive. Got Bs in all but one of my lower level physics courses but got As in all upper level courses.
Overall GPA: 3.59
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: Unsure
Type of Student: Domestic white woman

GRE Scores :
Q: 158 (70%) lmao I have no excuse for this
V: 162 (92%)
W: 4.5 (I can't remember the percentile? 82% maybe?)
P: 810 (72%) Absolutely thrilled at this! I got a 650 (40%) on the first one


Research Experience: Been in a large, well known quantum computing group since beginning of June 2016. This is probably the most important thing on my application. I also did a semester long research project in a condensed matter group when I was a sophomore.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: My sophomore research project won most outstanding research poster at the undergraduate research fair at my school.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Was a learning assistant (basically a TA) for a physics for life sciences class for both semesters of my junior year, I assisted in teaching 7 sections total. I also graded for physics of music last semester.
I planned an assembly for a coalition of schools (the assembly was focused on equity and inclusion in physics, and there were physics education research faculty/graduate students attending. There were also straight up physics faculty, grad students, and undergrads attending too) -- this assembly was probably good for networking since two of the schools involved were Berkeley and Colorado so I was able to meet a lot of people from those two schools.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: I took graduate quantum last semester. It's also worth noting that my record has a very strong upward trajectory.

Special Bonus Points: My research adviser is probably one of the most well known people in quantum computing, and he has happened to have worked at two of the schools I am applying to.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I accidentally submitted my UCLA application two weeks late (I completed and paid for it but forgot to press the submit button, lol)

I'm filling one of these out late. I don't have a profile nearly as good as everyone on this site, so hopefully I get some acceptances and give hope to the "average" people reading but not posting on this board.

Undergrad Institution: Small liberal arts university, little to no research available, but has alumni working at NASA so any failures in physics in my life can rest with me and not the school I went to
Major(s):Physics
Minor(s):Mathematics
GPA in Major:3.92
Overall GPA:3.90
Length of Degree:3.5 years, graduated a semester early
Position in Class:only 5 of us in class
Type of Student: white domestic male
GRE Scores : (revised or old version?)
Q:160 (76%)
V: 159 (82%)
W: 4.5 (82%)
P: 640 (37%)



Research Experience: None. Huge problem with my profile. None available at my school, and 20+ REUs turned away from, many saying I made it to the final rounds of cuts though. Ugh. If I don't get in somewhere, I will try as hard as possible to get work at a lab somewhere and better this part of my profile (along with retaking GREs - my physics score is so bad because I didn't practice for speed, and answered less than half of the questions...)

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: SPS, Dean's list every semester, a scholarship

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: TA in a lab my final semester, founding member of my school's Astronomy Club

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Nope

Special Bonus Points: None

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: None

Applying to Where:

SUNY Stony Brook Accepted to Master's program, no funding, email, 2/22. Would go if I could afford it.
University of Rochester Rejected via email to check website, 2/13.
Carnegie Mellon
Brandeis University Invite to open house, received 2/7Rejected via email, 4/28.

University of Notre Dame Waitlisted by email, 3/10.Rejected via email, 4/14.
University of Pittsburgh High on the waitlist, upon email inquiry, 3/29. Rejected via email to check website, 4/18.
University of Oregon Rejected via email, 3/7.
University of Oklahoma Accepted via email, 2/3. $1600 per month TA. Will attend!
Arizona State University Rejected via email, 4/21.
University of Utah Rejected via email, 4/26.
Colorado State University First Acceptance! 1/31. $1985 per month for 9 months, TA
Florida State University
SUNY Buffalo Accepted via email, 2/22. $18,500 first year, TA
Lehigh University Accepted via email, 4/11. ~$28,000 per year TA
Kansas State University Waitlisted by email, 2/1.

I'm worried that I overshot a little bit with my pGRE score and lack of research. Oh well. I'm also a little worried that it's 1/30 and I haven't heard anything yet. And I gave preferences of field in each application, but was very open and not hard on any of them. This may have hurt me too...

Well, I got into a school I'm happy with. A nice variety of research in my fields of interest. If I were to change anything, it would be going to a public research university for undergrad. Off to complete my dreams!

I have never imagined to have such a wonderful result for my grad application, and I hope this will help future hep-th applicants to gain more confidence in their profile; unlike some really amazing profiles in this forum, I didn't do an outstanding amount of research (only two summer in relevant field), I don't have any publications or conference presentations, I don't have a bunch of awards, and I didn't take a crazy lots of grad courses. Of course I worked really hard for both of my research positions and had great relationships with my supervisors, but I'm sure most of you have done that too. Best of luck to everyone! May our hard work pays off.

Research Experience: 3.5 years working with a condensed matter lab at my university. We grow, characterize, and perform measurements on high-temperature superconductors, which continues to be a hot topic in condensed matter. Unfortunately I don't have any publications yet, mostly due to materials issues we've had with moving labs (new environment, getting growths under control was difficult). However, I will be on at least one paper by the time I leave. I have several posters of projects I've done submitted to my university's digital conservancy.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Several top departmental scholarships, as well as one external through my mother's company (I'm very lucky). Also Dean's List for all semesters.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Grading honors level courses for a year.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Not really

Special Bonus Points: 1 grad course + lots of physics and math electives. I've also been to several national laboratory experiments as part of my research group, assisting with data analysis and experiment preparation. We have yet to get published from these as for several of them the data are not good enough and the results aren't conclusive. I also feel that I have strong recommendations.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Nothing I can think of.

I got very little reference for the application from the former students in my home school. Basically, no one works on AMO before. So I apply for a lot of gradschools.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Undergrad Institution: Chinese university (ranking 200-300 globalwide?)
Major: Physics
Minor: N/A
GPA in Major: 3.99/4.0 (~94/100)
Overall GPA: 3.98/4.0 (92.3/100)
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: 1/43
Type of Student: International , male

GRE Scores : 322 (revised)
Q: 170
V: 152 :|
W: 3.0 :(
P: 990

TOEFL Total: 105 (R29,L27,S24,W25)

Research Experience: Two years on AMO theory in home school resulted in one first-authored PRA on quantum metrology (accpeted after the application but some schools did allow me to update my CV), one summer research on trapped ion experiment in UCLA, currently working on superfluidity of cold atoms (theory) for my diploma thesis in MPQ (I listed it in my CV but didn't elaborate too much cuz I just started)

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Two National Scholarships, one Second Prize for a domestic competition, an award for outstanding performance in UCLA's summer program

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: President of physics association in home school (similar to SPS in the states)

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

Recommendations: four recommendations, one from my advisor in home school, he knows me good, I think it should be quite strong; one from advisor in UCLA, I don't think I did very good in the past summer but it should be fine; one from a Polish professor, I did a good job on his lecture; one from a professor who is the advisor of our physics association.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I got both experiences in exp/th

Applying to Where:

CU Boulder - Physics - AMO Accepted via email (Feb. 3rd), coming with 2k signing bonus. Will attending

This thread was a stress inducer like nothing else but the web-site in general was beyond useful, so here is my modest contribution.

Undergrad Institution: Small private US uni in top-50, okay reputation in physics, good in engineering
Major(s): Astro & Maths
GPA in Major: 3.93 & 3.94, resp.
Overall GPA: 3.90
Length of Degree: 4 years at home institution + 1 year abroad (top-2 UK uni, 3.81 GPA)
Position in Class: not a clue
Type of Student: European white male

GRE Scores : (revised)
Q: 170 (97%)
V: 161 (88%)
W: 3.5 (42%)
P: 740 (59%)

Research Experience (in chronological order; current semester activities excluded hereafter since admission committees can't consider those (duh)):
• An irrelevant research in biology that I started working on while in high school, resulted in a publication which I briefly mentioned in my CV. There was also a poster presentation but that I didn't mention at all
• Research in maths at my school, ~1.5 yrs, the paper (with me as 3rd author) is submitted and will likely be published (too bad graduate schools won't know that until the decision is made)
• Research in QCD at my school (as part of STAR collaboration), ~4 months and ongoing, no papers
So not a ton

Awards/Honors/Recognitions:
PMU, Dean's list, President's scholar, some departmental awards, something for study abroad

Pertinent Activities or Jobs:
• Private tutor for couple years
• Grader for linear algebra, one semester
• TA for analysis, one semester
• Treasurer of astro club
• Pres of math & stat club
• [Probably irrelevant] voluntary activities

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:
Graduating with honors in both degrees

Special Bonus Points:
Took grad classes in maths while in the UK. No connections, 2/3 recommenders are not physicists but all can speak for my ability to do research and/or teach. Where I was allowed to, I listed a prof from the UK uni as the fourth recommender. As for minorities, I'm technically jewish but I didn't mention that (not much of a minority). Variety of technical skills (e.g. programming experience, machine shop). Speak a few languages.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:
• My GRE AW score is quite abysmal (by the standards of this forum at least), so I asked my recommenders to reflect on my writing skills
• In the math&stat club, we actively promote ug research and hold info sessions to help students get internships and jobs. So ofc I mentioned that in SoP
• With the exception of a few schools, I contacted faculty before applying

Applying to Where: unless specified otherwise, department of astro / physics & astro, expressed interest in exoplanets (especially planet formation)

Figured it's my time to make a contribution here, considering the people who comprise most of the site traffic I think it'll be useful to add a profile that's a bit different than the norm. Lower GPA is mainly attributed to a semester of dealing with depression (recent semesters: ~3.7)

Undergrad Institution: Small-ish public liberal arts (NY) with renowned tough physics program
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): Mathematics, College Honors Program
GPA in Major: 2.83
Overall GPA: 3.40
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: College doesn't rank, but reasonably decent
Type of Student: Domestic white/Asian male

GRE Scores :
Q:163 (85%)
V: 162 (90%)
W: 3.0 (17%) Reports/papers for coursework have been top quality, no idea what happened here
P: 600 (28%) :wink:


Research Experience: A year and a half spent on stellar photometry with the WIYN Open Cluster Study (WOCS)

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Several dean's lists, Honors Program is highly respected

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Private and/or unofficial tutor in intro physics/astronomy, statistics, linear algebra, programming

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Departmental visits at the more local universities (1-on-1 tours!), national leadership conference attendance

Special Bonus Points: One letter writer (my research advisor) is a WOCS collaborator with his alma mater where I'm applying

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Nothing out of the ordinary

Applying to Where: This is where things get interesting, delving into the astro and chemistry paths

RIT - Color Science PhD Accepted 2/15!! Full tuition waived + bonus 20k assistantship
Univ. of Rochester - Chemical Engineering - Alt. Energy Accepted 1/23, half tuition covered

TOEFL Total: 111

Research Experience:

1. REU working on star clusters. Paper in progress.
2. A project working on asteroids (citizen science website Comethunters.org). Paper in progress.
3. A short project at the national space agency working on a spectrograph pipeline
4. A project on cleaning stellar spectra for RV detection (Did this after graduating from college)
5. Senior thesis on parallel gravitational N-Body simulations. (Convinced a faculty member of home department whose research interest is parallel computing)

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Nothing significant

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: None

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Nothing special

Special Bonus Points: I got selected for and attended various schools and workshops organised by Astronomy institutes in my country. Some of them were very selective. Due to lack of curriculum courses in astronomy/planetary sciences, I did about 14 MOOCs in these fields.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:
1. In my SOP I expressed interest in Astrobiology very specifically, with ideas about the kind of research I would like to pursue.
2. Since I wish to change fields, I had to struggle hard to get opportunities in Astronomy. I did manage to do a decent number of projects and do a lot of self study, including reading scientific papers and articles regularly. The grad chair in an admission interview (LPL) specifically mentioned that he was impressed by my tenacity. So, I guess that mattered a lot for my profile.
3. I took a year off after graduating college. This helped me do some additional projects and decently prepare for GRE Physics.

Applying to Where: Research Interest is uniformly Astrobiology, with topics spanning both exoplanets and solar system objects.

Advice: I have read that many applicants strongly regret not seeking the advice of their advisors or PI. Consulting with many faculty members has two important consequences. Namely, your letter writers will not actively contradict what you write in your statement, and they will point out any mistakes or faux pas you've made that a physicist would notice. Lastly, be sure to have an English PhD read your statement over if you can. Often, the content of your statement will be strong, but not strongly written, and it takes someone with extensive experience to help put it together in a convincing and meaningful way.

Things seem to be going shockingly well, so here's a post from someone with an imperfect score and doing theory!

Undergrad Institution: private R1. good overall, good in bio, good in biophysics, but not great physics rep.
Major: Physics + Bio
GPA in Major: 3.9
Overall GPA: 3.8
Length of Degree: 4
Position in Class: idk?
Type of Student: Domestic white female

GRE Scores : (revised)
Q: 168 94
V: 169 98
W: 6.0 99
P: 900 85

Research Experience: Two first author papers (different topics), one in a fancy journal. Probably two more at least submitted by the time I graduate. Have given a poster presentation, a talk at aps, and a talk at another conference. Have been working with my current PI for nearly 4 years.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Travel awards, a grant funding research, and a scholarship for college.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: I tutor and TA a *lot*. Didn't occur to me that it would even help, I just really like doing it :).

Special Bonus Points: My PI is pretty well known in the field, and has friends at most places I've applied. I've met a lot of the potential PIs previously, through summer programs, conferences, or them visiting for talks. I would guess that he and my other recommenders (all of whom have worked with me for research) wrote very strong letters.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:
Although my gpa looks decent, I've done pretty poorly in a few upper-level physics courses, which is probably related to some family circumstances at the time. I didn't feel comfortable writing about it in the explanations section, though, so I assumed that would hurt my chances (given that I do theory!).
I've also done a lot of work with various non-science organizations that aim to increase diversity in higher ed.

Applying for biophysics theory everywhere.


Harvard - Physics - Accepted!!
Stanford - Applied Physics - Accepted!!
Columbia - Physics - withdrew application
UCSB - Physics - Accepted!!
UCSD - Physics - Accepted!!
MIT - Physics - Accepted!!
Princeton - Physics - Accepted!!
BU - Physics - Accepted!!
Rutgers - Physics - Accepted!!
Berkeley - Physics
Cornell - Physics - Accepted!!
Harvard - Biophysics - Accepted!!
Rockefeller - (they only have 1 program) - invited for interview, not going



A note based on progress so far: apparently it's possible to get in even for theory with an imperfect transcript and a less-than-stellar pgre. I'm pretty sure my recommendation letters were what pushed a lot of places into yes's, but also the fact that I had a real paper (something a lot of the PI's I've been talking to about possible positions actually read and liked) probably helps a lot.

The information here has been helped me, and I hope my admission results will be helpful also.
______________________________________________
Undergrad Institution: One of the top universities in Asia. Good reputation in Physics.
Major(s): Applied Physics
Minor(s): Liberal arts
GPA in Major: 4.0
Overall GPA: 3.5
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: Not available, but probably near top
Type of Student: International male

GRE Scores :
Q: 170 (97%)
V: 156 (72%) :(
W: 3.5 (42%) :? Hope this will not bite me later
P: 990 (94%) (Past exam questions available on the web were most helpful for me. Just practice for more speed!)

For those who is going to take PGRE at Duksung women's university in South Korea, please be careful. There are two campuses 20km away from each other and it is not clear which one is your test place only from the letter from ETS. (I nearly missed the exam!)

TOEFL Total: 109 (R:30, L:30, W:26, S:23)
Sometimes speaking score of 23 is not enough for the requirements. However usually when I contact the admission offices, they allowed me to compensate for the score with my IELTS speaking score (7.0). Maybe, these borders are not hard fixed.


Research Experience: One year of research about atomic spectroscopy at a well known research institute. In addition, 3 months of research intern about computer science at a well-known IT company, 2 months of research intern at a physics laboratory in Europe.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Received domestic scholarship for 2 years.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: NA (My department does not provide TA positions to undergraduate..)

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

Special Bonus Points: I think the recommendation letters are strong. No publications, though.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:

Applying to Where:
Applied for mostly quantum information and some AMO.

Caltech - Applied physics - Accepted 2/13 via email! - 34k TA, RA and fellowship/yr
U Maryland - Physics - Accepted 2/10 via email! - 25k TA or RA stipend/yr
Stanford - Applied physics - Accepted 2/06 via email! - 3.3k RA/month
GeorgiaTech - Physics - Accepted 2/20 on website - 25k TA/yr
MIT - Physics - Rejected 2/28 via email - Ouch :( Though I was in the waitlist for a while, I could not make it. Well, I did all what I could do.
U Chicago - Physics - Rejected 2/20 on website
Princeton - Electrical engineering (Applied physics) - Rejected 2/14 by email - Bit sad, but I did my best :( I have to say that my background in electrical engineering might have been weak.
Yale - Physics - Rejected 3/7 on website

Reflection:
Most of the universities which I could get admitted are those with many faculty members doing research about quantum information. (Caltech has IQIM, UMD has JQI and Stanford also has quite a lot of people in the field) Though I had strong recommendation letters, I was not the perfect candidate with great journal publications, perfect GRE scores and so forth, and as can be seen from the admission results, I think I was on the line of acceptance and rejection. Therefore, probably whether the research interest written in SOP matches was the thing which decided the outcome for each school.
Another thing I would like to state is that SOP does not have to be written in perfect English, or at least reasonable amount of grammatical errors do not kill you immediately. My written English is far from perfect (See my TOEFL and GRE writing scores, or you may be able to see that in my writing on this post :shock: ), and once my English is reviewed by native English speakers, they find a lot of errors... For my applications, I tried my best to make my writing look as good as possible, but I did not have time to ask for comments from native English speakers. I hope this gives a bit of hope to those who are not very confident with their English as me (Of course it would be much nicer to find somebody to check your English if possible).

Didn't apply to safety schools. It was risky and I worried that a low pGRE might kill my chances... Actually, it might have been a factor for rejections. But there are so many factors in grad schools decisions... And all it takes is one yes, from one school !

I wanted to post this for future applicants. Scores can matter less than what you'd think. Trust yourself and keep hope :)

Undergrad Institution: Average size state school, small physics department
Major/Minor: Physics/Math
GPA in Major: 3.45
Overall GPA: 3.35
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: No Clue
Graduate Institution (M.S.): Top state school for Mechanical Engineering
Major: Mechanical Engineering
GPA: 3.9
Length of Degree: 3 years (took longer because my BS was in Physics and I didn't "know" enough of the engineering from undergrad
Position in Class: No Clue but I graduated with distinction
Type of Student: Domestic white male

GRE Scores
Q: 164 (87%)
V: 153 (60%)
W: 4.5 (82%)
P: 800 (70%)

Undergrad Research Experience: 2-3 years of experimental AMO research. Summer internship at NIF. No papers/publications from undergrad.

Graduate Research Experience: Nothing physics related. I was a graduate researcher, but mechanical engineering. I have 2 conference publications and my masters thesis publication.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: I actually worked as a structural analyst for a rocket engine company after my MS. I realized I wanted to get my PhD in Physics so I quit and started working as a Mechanical Engineer for a Physics group hunting dark matter. After submitting my applications I got another job as a structural analyst for a different defense company (pays WAY more than the research job and it's just temporary, hopefully).

Special Bonus Points: I should have 4 really good letters of recommendations, 1 from undergrad, two from grad and 1 from the physics professor I worked for after finishing my MS. My undergrad LOR has connections at UW Madison and Ohio State, and the professor I worked for post MS has a connection at Columbia.

Undergrad Institution: Large state school well regarded in physics
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): Mathematics, Spanish
GPA in Major: 4.00
Overall GPA: 3.98
Length of Degree: 4
Position in Class: "Highest Distinction" (Top 2% in College of Science)
Type of Student: Domestic white male

GRE Scores :
Q: 165 (89%)
V: 162 (90%)
W: 3.5 (42%)
P: 800 (70%)


Research Experience: Two REUs, both at my undergrad institution. First one in applied mathematics focusing on stability analysis in toy models of nanostructures. My second one was a bit out of the ordinary, I did work with a climate risk analysis institute at my university and programmed a computer model of human heat stress and used it to make predictions about future habitability of certain zones. This formed the basis of my honors thesis. It wasn't very "physics-y" to be honest.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Honors College, Phi Beta Kappa, Sigma Pi Sigma, full tuition scholarship from my phys dept for senior year. Was a finalist in a public speaking contest with over 1000 contestants at my university

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: I was the co-chair of my school's Sigma Pi Sigma induction and did some freelance tutoring, but not much else

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: I have a few useful computer programs that I've written and maintain on my website related to nonlinear dynamics / applied math.

Special Bonus Points: One of my recommenders is slightly famous, but in exoplanet research, not what I want to go into.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I took a year off after finishing undergrad and did literally nothing. I really needed it to help rebuild my mental and physical health after the hell that was my senior year.

Applying to Where: All for theory, slightly different specifics for each

Princeton - Physics - Rejected 2/16 via email
Chicago - Physics - Rejected 2/17 via email
U Penn - Physics - Rejected 4/6 via email
Maryland - Physics - Accepted 2/9 via email
Johns Hopkins - Physics - Rejected 3/20 via email
Cornell - Physics - Rejected 2/14 via email
Brown - Physics - Rejected 2/22 via email
Boston U - Physics - Rejected 4/7 via email
Carnegie Mellon - Physics - Accepted 2/17 via email - Will Attend
Pittsburgh - Physics - withdrawing app
Drexel - Physics - Received invitation to open house on 2/15, but withdrawing app


Overall, I was extremely happy with the two choices I had, and my visit at CMU really won me over from UMD.

Undergrad Institution: (School or type of school, such as big state, lib arts, ivy, technical, foreign (what country?)... Overall Reputation in Physics?)
Montclair State University - Not particularly big and has tiny physics program.
University of Delaware - Obtained my first degree in art, photography. Not very relevant so I will leave further info about this out
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): Math
GPA in Major: 3.1
Overall GPA: 3.21
Length of Degree: (Are you graduating after 3, 4, or 5 years?)
2.5 years (expedited due to having acquired my first degree)
Position in Class: (No numbers needed, but are you top? near top? average? struggling?)
Not sure, but I would say above average
Type of Student: (Domestic/International, male/female, minority?) Domestic Male

GRE Scores : (revised or old version?)
Q: 160 (78%)
V: 156 (72%)
W: 4.5 (82%)
P: 620 (33%) :shock:



Research Experience:
1.5 years, and still ongoing, in Ultrasound Image Processing. No papers or presentations.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Tutor High School and Intro level physics. Continuing research after graduations.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: I failed physics before getting my first degree. My accomplishment is bouncing back to earn a degree in it.

Special Bonus Points: This is probably common but I continued to self-study and participate in relevant courses at a nearby campus. Also, I had one fricken fantastic LOR, probably a 2nd good LOR, but a third mediocre LOR

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Well rounded- play sports, look for new skills such as building electronics, the type of stuff you expect is important for applying to undergrad from high school, but more mature haha

Applying to Where:
First, given my poor academic profile I had no clue how to choose schools. I basically picked across the range of rankings in ideal locations with relevant programs. Also, in general, I am looking to study imaging. Whether this means stuff like spectroscopy and electron microscopy or medical imaging will be dependent on the school i choose and how i feel once there. With that low PGRE score I made a switch over to electrical engineering (EE) since I'll be doing the same stuff anyway, just with a difference in coursework.

I have a large list, but only because a lot of fees were waived. Those UC schools waive fees easy if you qualify.

All applications were for PhD.

EE: (sorry if i forget the specific subfield title)

UCSD - EE - Imaging related Accepted 3/27, but only to Master's program with no guarenteed funding. No PhD
UCSB - EE - Materials and nanodevices
UCSC - EE - Imaging related Rejected via Email on 3/7-- They took someone else form my undergrad with more aligned goals. Cant argue with that.
UC-Riverside - EE - Imaging related
UC-Merced - EE - Imaging related
U. of Southern Florida - EE - Imaging related (big on medical here) Rejected via Email 3/23

Physics: Specifically, AMO. Schools without AMO are CM or simply applied or engineering physics. All experimental

Rutgers-NB - Physics - CME (Update - Called, 4/5, ALL decisions and waitlist have been made. Results should post by end of week. However, If I havent heard from them yet its likely i was not accepted...... Rutgers failed to post results. Typical Rutgers, so poor
Rutgers-Newark - Physics - AMO
Arizona State University - Physics - Nanoscience and Materials Physics - Accepted, 2/10; Full funding, TA at$7,630 ish per semester
Lehigh U. - Physics - AMO
Stevens Institute of Tech. - Physics - Applied Physics
NJIT - Physics - Engineering Physics Rejected via website 4/12

Optics:

U. of Arizona - Optics Accepted 3/1, but only to their Masters program. No guaranteed funding, but possible assistant positions.
U. of Rochester - Optics Rejected via email 2/9
U. of Central Florida - Optics

I was worried about physics programs with that Low PGRE score and generally worried about getting in anywhere at all with low GPA and only average general GRE scores. My letters of recommendation definitely helped and I believe a lot has to do with my SOP and other supplemental essays. I believe I showed sincere interest in most of the programs through my writing and coupled with age and maturity they know I am serious. Thats my only explanation for getting in anywhere. Lets see if I get into more and have to change my statement haha.

It definitely goes to show that you don't need a perfect profile to get into a PhD program. With my profile one may not get into an Ivy or a one of the other 2 or 3 top programs, but a good program is still doable. I need to hear back from a few more schools before committing to one.

Good Luck to the rest of ya!

Applied to a wide range of schools since I was not confident at all about my chances. I did not contact any schools or professors in advance, and none of the schools interviewed me. Walked into the GRE's with no more than 2 hours of preparation. Started writing SoP the day before due date and had no one else look over it. I am serious about physics graduate school, but I stayed true to liberal arts education and spent most of my time on music, humanities, languages, etc. Worked for me but not recommended if you want the very top programs...

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Nothing of note

Applying to Where:
Focus is on cosmology instrumentation.

Caltech - Astronomy (Rejected 3/1 via email)
UC Boulder - Physics (Rejected 3/3 via email)
Michigan State - Astronomy
University of Arizona - Astronomy (Rejected 1/24 via email)
University of Minnesota - Astrophysics (Skype interview 2/24)(Admitted 4/14 with tuition waiver and $19,070/yr TA position - Offer accepted)
University of Chicago - Astronomy (Rejected 2/10 via email)
SUNY Stony Brook - Physics (Accepted for MA 2/22 via email)
McGill University - Physics
University of Massachusetts, Amherst - Astronomy (Rejected 3/3 via website)
University of Virginia - Astronomy (Rejected 2/12 via email)

Thought I was totally out of luck since all the rejections in March, until I got an email on 4/13 asking if I was still interested in UMN and that there would be an open spot if one more person declined their offer; received my offer of admission the next morning. I don't want to give people false hope, but the unexpected can happen, even with a mediocre GPA and shitty physics GRE.

Undergrad Institution: University of Oxford
Major(s): Physics (MPhys)
Overall GPA: 80% (top 10% of the year)
Length of Degree: 4 (with masters)
Position in Class: top 10% of the year
Type of Student: International but with US passport, white male

GRE Scores :
Q:162
V:168
W:4.0
P:990


Research Experience: Worked at WHOI for half a summer when I was 16, was very relaxed. Summer Camp doing plasma physics in summer of my 2nd year at USTC in China (only a few weeks). 8 weeks in CERN summer student program doing accelerator research (mainly MATLAB work). My masters project this year (4th year) is jet and population modelling of blazars with a look into axion like particles - sits nicely in between particle and astro fields (using python and C)

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Awarded academic scholarship every year at Oxford, awarded International strategy scholarship to fund research at CERN, finished top 50 in UK physics olympiad when I was 18 (gold award). Some school prizes and academic scholarships etc.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Have done a fair bit of private tutoring in maths and physics, brief stint editing student newspaper

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:Speak Spanish (I was born there) and row at a fairly high level, have trialled for the GB team and blue boat at Oxford

Special Bonus Points: No hook ups that ended up mattering, don't think my recommenders are particularly well known in US but I am sure they wrote pretty good references (atleast two of them did). I suppose being spanish may have possibly helped with being minority hispanic, however I highly doubt it. I emailed all the people I perhaps wanted to work with pretty late as well (like november\december)

Applying to Where:

Undergrad Institution: Small liberal arts school, no reputation for physics, only 4 physics faculty members
Major(s): Math and Physics
Minor(s):
GPA in Major: 4.0 in physics
Overall GPA: 3.91
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: near top? we don't rank...
Type of Student: domestic white female

GRE Scores : revised
Q: 167 (93%)
V: 165 (95%)
W: 5.0 (93%)
P: 610 (31%)

Research Experience: math REU in knot theory summer of 2015, internship at CERN summer 2016, no departmental research.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: math department award for non-graduating students, member of phi mu epsilon, deans list all 7 semesters so far

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: supplemental instruction leader (tutor/TA mix) for calc 3 and linear algebra for 3 years, worked at the national youth science camp, was a math grader a couple semesters.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: It's not super science related, but I was highly involved in my school's orientation and first year experience program. It included teaching an 'intro to college' class and facilitating discussions. I got lots of teaching and leadership experience from it, and that might help me stand out.

Special Bonus Points: I know I got extremely good letters of recommendation, and my personal statement is very strong(it was reviewed by a lot of people since most of it was used to apply for a fulbright grant.) I didn't get a letter of recommendation from my supervisor at CERN (my situation was weird, got bounced around between post docs with very poor english), but I found a good way to talk about it/give an excuse for the lack of letter in my personal statement.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I didn't contact any of the schools before applying. I know that seems like a big no-no, but I wasn't extremely interested in a single professors research at any schools so it felt weird to act like I was in an email. I also only sent my PGRE scores to the schools that required them (ASU, Dartmouth, Amherst, Buffalo, and Boulder).

Applying to Where:

UC Boulder - Physics - Hep-th 3/3 rejected by email
ASU - Physics - Hep-th
Stony Brook - Physics - Hep-th 2/22 accepted to master's program w/ no funding, given possibility to enter PhD program if I do well...
SUNY Buffalo - Physics - Hep-th 2/22 accepted! $18,500 TA stipend for the year
Dartmouth - Physics - Hep-th
Brown - Physics - Hep-th 3/20 rejected by email to check website
Tufts - Physics - Hep-th 3/27 rejected by email to check website
Northeastern - Physics - Hep-th 2/23 accepted! $11,595 TA stipend per semester, no info on summer funding
UMass Amherst - Physics - Hep-th 2/23 accepted! tuition waiver and TA position, $20,862 for academic year, up to $7,686 for summer RA position.
Brandeis - Physics - Hep-th

2/23: well, apparently having a shitty PGRE score and indicating you want to do theory research isn't the end of the world!

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tips from experience:

    Indians do have a shot at getting into really good (near the top) places without publications and without being from IIT/IISERs etc.
    Be true to yourself and show maturity in your SOP. I cannot stress this enough - NO STORIES in the SOP. Keep it formal, simple and to the point but include all details about previous research experience, future goals, teaching experience if any and try and show your motivation without being cheesy.
    I think undergraduate (and if applicable, graduate GPA) matters quite a lot. If you have a bad GPA, you must try and explain it in your SOP.
    It is okay to not have publications and other deficiencies if you show enough motivation by pursuing other academic activities like attending workshops, doing research in the summers, taking up teaching duties etc.

Undergrad Institution: Large state school, top 50 for physics.
Major(s): BS in Physics, BS in Computer Science
Minor(s): Math
GPA in Major: Let's say 3.3 -- did roughly the same in Physics and CS coursework. If I could summarize my entire undergraduate career, it would be this: "B+".
Overall GPA: Around 3.3 as well.
Length of Degree: 4 years.
Position in Class: Unknown.
But wait! There's more!
Major(s): MS in Computer Science at undergrad institution.
GPA in Major: 3.9. Whew, much better! 8)
Length of Degree: 2 years.
Type of Student: Domestic white female.

GRE Scores :
Q: 166 (91%)
V: 164 (94%)
W: 4.0 (59%)
P: 710 (53%)

I worked hard for that 710 and I'm proud of it. Why is it so low? Well, I took this test a couple of times and I never really mastered the speed aspect. Time was typically called before I had a chance to look at the last 25-30% of the test questions. If I were to do this all over again, I'd practice under testing conditions as much as possible while Cake's "The Distance" played in the background. :wink:

Research Experience: About 2.5 years of undergraduate research (quantum information in a CMT group) at home institution, which culminated in an Honors Thesis. This project carried on for an additional two years and resulted in a PRA publication. Additionally, two years of research in data clustering in CS department for my MS.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: A couple of scholarships and a best student talk award at a department expo when I was a grad student. That's about it.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Well, I've been a TA and an RA as a graduate student. I'm currently a faculty member in my department now, teaching 3000/4000 level undergraduate courses.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Not that I can think of.

Special Bonus Points: I've been taking graduate physics courses while teaching CS undergrad courses over the past two years. I'm hoping that the fact that I did very well as a graduate student can mitigate my low undergraduate GPA.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:

Undergrad Institution: Top 20 in Physics
Major(s): Physics
GPA in Major: 3.62
Overall GPA: 3.74
Length of Degree: 4 years undergraduate
Position in Class: Not sure. Guessing average.
Type of Student: International male

GRE Scores :
Q: 165 (89%)
V: 162 (90%)
W: 4.0 (56%)
P: 780 (67%)

The PGRE left me perplexed. I enjoyed studying for it, did well on practice exams, but always scored in the 700s.

Research Experience:
One summer and two years part-time at my school. Research in Astronomy, data-intensive project. One nth publication.
A year and a half in the industry. Research in Biomedicine and Computational Statistics. Lead author on an open-source software, contributor to a major statistical software, contributor to an R package. Two conference posters, guest speaker at a conference and at a meetup event, TA for two programming workshops.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Not sure it counts, but got a promotion at my research job.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs:
Two years as a peer tutor, one summer in patent law.

Special Bonus Points:
4 letter writers in different fields: Physics, Astronomy, Biomedicine, Statistics -- that's just how it worked out. One of the letter writers was from a program I applied to (and got into).
Met professors at conferences or called them. Visited a few schools before applying. Sometimes helped, sometimes didn't, but a fun and educating experience.

Applying to Where:
I think at heart I'm an applied statistician/mathematician. There are great statistical problems in Astronomy and in the life sciences (maybe particularly at the interface of Physics and Biology).

Johns Hopkins - Physics & Astronomy - Soft Condensed Matter, Astronomy - accepted (TA stipend)
U. Penn - Physics & Astronomy - Biophysics, Soft Condensed Matter -
NYU - Physics & Astronomy - Soft Condensed Matter, Astronomy - rejected
U. Chicago - Physics - Biophysics, Astrophysics - rejected

Duke - Statistical Sciences - Computational Biology - rejected
Brown - Biostatistics - Pharmacometrics - rejected for PhD, accepted for masters
Harvard - Systems Biology - rejected
MIT - Computational & Systems Biology - rejected
Rutgers - Quantitative Biomedicine - accepted

Comments
When I applied last year, I didn't make it past waitlists. Grad school is competitive, and part of me wishes I had prepared for it earlier during my undergrad career. That said, I loved taking some time off and working in the industry. I had a chance to explore new fields, meet a lot of great people, and do fun research. I'm very excited and humbled to start my PhD next year. I'm not 100% sure why certain programs versus others worked out. I applied to competitive programs without a perfect profile, so I needed a bit of luck.

Best wishes to everyone!

Special Bonus Points: one of my recommenders is very famous in AMO

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I took a long time to get through school. I started out as pre-med/chem major at an Ivy, dropped out after a year and half a semester (with all withdrawals from that on my transcript) with a 3.44 GPA. went to paramedic school (2 years), decided I hated that, went back to college pre-med again, took a physics class my first semester and switched over to physics. transferred schools again (private to public because money and also the public school was WAY better at physics), and three years there. private school GPA was a 3.856, public school GPA is a 3.98. Life is complicated. I imagine my first year of college in 2010 isn't very noteworthy to most grad programs, especially since I retook the math class I took then anyway.

Applying to Where: All for AMO experiment, all in Physics except for one which is noted

Thoughts - I would like to point out that I only contacted professors from Berkeley, Boulder, and Michigan, and I never received a response from Boulder. I also realized that (I think) what you put in your SOP matters in terms of research interests lining up with the universities, and that it's okay to talk about interests in other research areas besides what you did as an undergrad. One good piece of advice I received was to play your strengths when writing your SOP; once you're in, you can do whatever research you want.

Putting this up to get closure to an exciting/nerve-wracking time and also provide dates of when I heard back so future applicants know when to expect decisions

Undergrad Institution: Top twenty private research school. OK in AMO but otherwise not known for physics
Major(s): Astrophysics
Minor(s):
GPA in Major: 4.19 (3.99 if A+ is only a 4)
Overall GPA: 4.17
Length of Degree: (Are you graduating after 3, 4, or 5 years?) 5
Position in Class: (No numbers needed, but are you top? near top? average? struggling?) I know I am in top 5% overall
Type of Student: (Domestic/International, male/female, minority?) domestic white dude

GRE Scores : (revised or old version?)
Q: 167
V: 167
W: 5.0
P: 990


Research Experience: (At your school or elsewhere? What field? How much time? Any publications (Mth author out of N?) or conference talks etc...) Started doing research only my junior year (year 3 out of 5) which is a bit late. Did an REU down in Chile that ended in a submitted paper (hadn't been accepted by the time of applications). Did about 9 months of research each with two faculty members at my home institution. One in star formation and one in theoretical cosmology. No other publications or serious presentations.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: (Within your school or outside?) A couple best student/best thesis awards.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: (Such as tutor, TA, SPS officer etc...) No

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

Special Bonus Points: (Such as connections, grad classes, famous recommenders, female or minority status etc...) I took two classes each with my two recommenders at my home institution getting all A+'s and I think this allowed them to give really strong letters and I think this really helped. Had maybe 6 grad classes in the end, including multiple astrophysics ones.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Was a pretty involved amateur astronomer/astrophotographer growing up and so this might help for the astronomy programs. I mentioned this briefly in my SOP's but I am not sure it helped in any way.

Applying to Where:
I didn't contact faculty anywhere before I applied. Expressed interest in Cosmology/DM everywhere which is a pretty new field to me

Harvard - Astronomy - Cosmology Accepted 2/8/2017.
Princeton - Astrophysics - Cosmology Accepted by email 2/2/2017. Will attend!
Stanford - Physics - Cosmology/Astro Accepted 2/10/2017.
MIT - Physics - Cosmology/HEP-th Accepted 2/9/2017.
Caltech - Astronomy - Cosmology/Dark matter Rejected 3/2/2017
UChicago - Astronomy - Cosmology Rejected 2/10/2017
Rutgers - Physics - Cosmology Accepted 2/7/2017.
UCSB - Physics - Cosmology Accepted 1/26/2017.

Cornell - Astronomy - Cosmology Accepted 2/6/2017.
Rice - Physics - Cosmology Accepted 1/25/2017.
Univ Arizona - Astronomy - Cosmology Accepted 1/19/2017.

Overall I am very happy/relieved with how it all turned out and can't wait to start school. wish the best of luck to my fellow applicants in their grad school careers and to future applications as well

I applied to 25 universities, all of them were Ph.D. programs. :P

Updated as of April 17, 2017

WILL ATTEND!

:mrgreen: University of Arizona - Physics - Cosmology (Feb. 09: Unofficial acceptance, email sent by Professor Rozo; Feb. 14: ACCEPTED for Ph.D via email + $18k/9 month TA + $3.5k-7.5k/summer + $2k/month Premium Health Insurance) This was my 1st response and 1st acceptance!!! Can you believe that?...no suffering for me. This one was on my top 3, dream came true! I cried from happiness!. I love it because UA has excellent Physics Ph.D. program (specially in astrophysics and cosmology), renowned faculty, good reputation, great campus, nice weather, Tucson is cheap, is ranked #1 in sexiest girls, and even the colors of UA are great!. Professor Rozo, who is an awesome cosmologist, was extremely nice with me after acceptance and hope him to be my advisor. Thanks UA!!! BEAR DOWN!!! :mrgreen:

ACCEPTED

:arrow: UCONN - Physics – Cosmology (Feb. 14: ACCEPTED for Ph.D via website, Feb. 15: Official offer for Ph.D via email + $11.5k Half Predoctoral Fellowship + $11.5k/9 month TA) :D This was my 2nd response and 2nd acceptance!!! I was very lucky. Very nice research in physics (specially in time), beautiful campus, but doesn't have as good reputation as UA, so I declined the offer. Thanks UCONN!!!
:arrow: Oklahoma - Physics - Cosmology (Mar. 09: ACCEPTED for Ph.D via email + declined before an official offer was made) :D I was contacted to know if I was still interested before the official offer was made. I decided to go to UA, so I declined the offer. Thanks OU!!!

WAITLISTED

:| Ohio State - Physics – Cosmology (Mar. 15: Waitlisted via email) :) It is great to be waitlisted by such a great program, this was on my top 3. Told them to keep me out of waitlist because I had already accepted UA offer, but still got a rejection letter on Apr. 11.
:| U Wyoming - Physics - Research Interest (Apr. 01: Waitlisted via email) :lol: I was announced that I had been waitlisted along with the rejection email on Apr. 01. This was an ultra top safety University...well at least now I know I won't be eaten by a bear.

REJECTED

:!: UNC-Chapel Hill - Physics - Cosmology (Feb. 17: Rejected via website) :? First rejection...didn't hurt, but I can't understand why.
:!: Brown - Physics - Cosmology (Feb. 22: Rejected via email; Feb. 22: Rejected via website) :? Offer to apply MS, no Ivy League for me.
:!: Northeastern - Physics – Complex Networks (Feb. 23: Rejected via website) :shock: This was my top safety university.
:!: Vanderbilt - Astrophysics - Cosmology (Mar. 03: Rejected via website) :roll: Well...thought I would make it.
:!: Penn State - Physics - Cosmology (Mar. 09: Rejected via email) :wink: Great university and my top application, I expected this.
:!: NYU - Physics - Cosmology (Mar. 15: Rejected via email) :? Great cosmology group, I am happy of not having to live at NY though.
:!: Notre Dame - Physics - Astrophysics (Mar. 17: Rejected via website) :roll: Well...beautiful campus though.
:!: NCSU - Physics - Astrophysics (Mar. 28: Rejected via website) :shock: Safety university, cosmology is way better than astrophysics.
:!: Utah State - Physics - Field Theory (Mar. 28: Rejected via email) :shock: Another safety university but very small, that makes it harder.
:!: Minnesota - Astrophysics - Cosmology (Mar. 29: Rejected via website) :? This was a very nice program, but still wasn't in my top.
:!: UMass - Amherst - Physics - Fundamental Interactions (Apr. 07: Rejected via website) :? I thought I would be at least waitlisted.
:!: Purdue - Physics - Cosmology (Apr. 10: Rejected via website) :wink: This was expected, but I don't care.

NO RESPONSE

:?: Rensselaer PI - Physics - Research Interest (Apr. 17: No response, neither by email nor website) :? Applied on Dec. 30. I paid!.

OTHER

:x Michigan State - Physics - Research Interest (Dec. 27: Tried to apply) :evil: Lost my TOEFL and GREs scores. They didn't care.
:x SUNY-Buffalo - Physics - Cosmology (Dec. 27: Tried to apply) :evil: Lost my General GRE scores and told me to send them again.
:x FSU - Physics - Research Interest (Jan. 15: Tried to apply) :evil: Didn't accepted my official transcripts (sent from another continent).


I am extremely happy about how things went, I was able to enter to one of my top 3 dream universities. I was very lucky that I was accepted in my first two responses, I didn't had to deal with the stress and anxiety of the first rejection. I am also glad that I didn't had to choose between two of my top 3 universities, I consider myself extremely blessed for this. If I had to do the process over again I would do it with a little more of time, specially being an international student. The truth is that, for international applicants, this is a very hard, exhausting, and quite expensive process, so be aware of that if you are considering to apply to the USA. I would like to thank my sisters, who obtained their Ph.D.s in important universities in the USA (UIUC & UW-Madison), and who helped me a lot for my application process. I hope my experience will help you through this process, wish you success, and my advice for new applicants is: "Apply with all your effort or do not apply, but do not just try."

Undergrad Institution: Small, highly-ranked liberal arts college
Major(s): Astrophysics
GPA in Major: 3.3 (this is average here; we have a grade deflation policy)
Overall GPA: 3.3
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: probably lower to middle third
Type of Student: Domestic white female

GRE Scores
Q: 163 (92%)
V: 163 (85%)
W: 4.5 (82%)
P: 610 (31%)


Research Experience: Two REUs in astronomy and two semesters of research in a molecular spectroscopy lab at my home institution

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: None academically in college (well... none by the time I applied, I was nominated to Sigma Xi in May)

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Grader for physics department, volunteer at observatory at school (led hands-on meteorite lessons for kids). Treasurer of institution's chapter of Society of Physics Students and student representative to department meetings.

Special Bonus Points: Upward trend in GPA. Audited a grad-level cosmology class at MIT. Took plenty of non-required STEM classes but had poor grades in math and computer science. Presented poster at AAS two years in a row, presented at a local astro conference, two conference presentations at my school. Varsity track & xc team member, including two-time all-conference selection.

Applying to: Waitlist Rejected Accepted Other

Dartmouth – Computational stellar/cosmology: email 2/6, ACCEPTED $29,070 - had emailed a professor beforehand
University of Washington – Computational astro: email 1/31 - no interview, emailed or talked to no one before applying
University of California San Diego – Computational astro: email 2/24 - emailed or talked to no one before applying but thought this would be a safety whoops
Johns Hopkins University – Computational astro (espec cosmology): by email 3/9. talked to a few grad students at a conference but no professors. email said 350 applicants for 20 spots (5.7% acceptance rate)
Carnegie Mellon University – Computational astro: email 3/30 - emailed/talked to no one there before applying
University of Rochester – Computational astro (espec stellar/galactic): email 3/6 - emailed/talked to two professors and got my advisor to recommend me to a professor, so really surprised by this one! According to a professor I talked to there, the program is a bit "archaic" - so perhaps PGRE scores are weighted more strongly?
Rochester Institute of Technology – Computational astro (espec cosmology): Waitlist 3/3 by email -
talked to no one before applying, but program fit my research goals outlined in my statement very well. email said that waitlist spots would be given based on research interest rather than just number of students that accepted spots
University of Michigan – Computational astro: ASU email 3/7 - talked to no one before applying
University of Massachusetts, Amherst – Computational astro: waitlisted by email 3/7 - surprised by this one; talked to a professor before applying that was an alum from my college and also talked to several grad students several times who seemed to like me quite a bit
University of Minnesota - Computational/instrumental astro: email 4/11 - accepted/rejected by inquiry.
Emailed inquiring about my status, said I had another offer but UMN was high on my list. Got a reply saying I was in top 20% of applicant pool "but did not make offers or waitlist". First paragraph was standard rejection letter, but second paragraph said that if people don't accept their waitlist offer they may have a spot and asked if I wanted to do an interview. In the interview, they asked me questions about my research and I answered them very well (I've presented my work a lot, so I've got this down). He told me he thought I was a very strong student and he wanted to accept me but needed other students to not accept their offer; emailed 20 minutes later with an offer for $19k. In a really tough decision, decided $19k was too low to reasonably pay student loans and that the extra $10k and the nicer location at Dartmouth (as well as proximity to my S.O.) was worth a lower in academic quality.

Morals here: FOLLOW UP EARLY WITH SCHOOLS YOU ARE INTERESTED IN. Be fluent in your research and your research interests; be passionate. Talk to professors before you apply (but be sure you have something to talk about! Because I didn't...).

My statements were a bit risky - I applied to a lot of schools in kinda hippy neighborhoods, so I mentioned in the last paragraph that I was a long-distance runner and a vegetarian so I fit in well in the locations. I had several typos in my resume that I didn't catch until later - PROOF-READ YOUR RESUMES VERY, VERY CAREFULLY! I think this hurt me a lot. That being said, I also found a typo in my statement to Dartmouth and that worked out okay.

My GPA is really low because of my college's grade deflation policy and I think that hurt me significantly, especially when not backed up by strong GRE scores and when there were typos in my resume. My research experience and my activities are fairly strong; this was my saving grace. Best of luck in your applications!

Undergrad Institution: University of Massachusetts Amherst. Rank ~70ish USNews. Okay rep in Physics. Nothing particular notable, as far as I'm aware. It does have the whole particle physics center going for it, though.
Major(s): Physics, Astronomy.
Minor(s):
GPA in Major: ~3.73
Overall GPA: ~3.75
Length of Degree: 3 years. Rushed it with 20+ creds a semester. Saved a load of money.
Position in Class: I like to think somewhere around ~85th percentile.
Type of Student: International. Indian male.

GRE Scores : Revised, I think.
Q: 164 ~87th percentile.
V: 160 ~85th percentile.
W: 5 don't remember percentile.
P: I'm not sure what this is.

Research Experience: 3 years in an inorganic chemistry lab. ~10ish hours a week, all 6 semesters. Internship for the summer of 2016. 2.5 months. One publication in Optics Express, 2nd author out of 3. One conference publication. Same author lineup. Got a publication from the chem lab in the press. 2nd out of 3. Also a patent from the internship. 1st name right after lab PI. Thing is, none of these were ready by the time I applied and were only mentioned as 'Submitted'. That might make a difference.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Chancellor's Scholarship, $12k/year. Nothing too prestigous. A fair number of people have it.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Nothing relevant to application. TA job in last semester after all apps done.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: None. I'm an uninteresting person.

Special Bonus Points: None that I'm aware of, unless Indian brown kid counts.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I mentioned a fair amount of experience with simulation tools and experiment automation.

Applying to Where:

All departments listed here as 'ECE' are just the school-relevant variants. So EECS, EE, ECE, et al.

Updated as of June 23, 2017

WILL ATTEND!

:mrgreen: University of Arizona - Physics - Cosmology (Feb. 09: Unofficial acceptance, email sent by Professor Rozo; Feb. 14: ACCEPTED for Ph.D via email + $18k/9 month TA + $3.5k-7.5k/summer + $2k/month Premium Health Insurance) This was my 1st response and 1st acceptance!!! Can you believe that?...no suffering for me. This one was on my top 3, dream came true! I cried from happiness!. I love it because UA has excellent Physics Ph.D. program (specially in astrophysics and cosmology), renowned faculty, good reputation, great campus, nice weather, Tucson is cheap, is ranked #1 in sexiest girls, and even the colors of UA are great!. Professor Rozo, who is an awesome cosmologist, was extremely nice with me after acceptance and hope him to be my advisor. Thanks UA!!! BEAR DOWN!!! :mrgreen:

ACCEPTED

:arrow: UCONN - Physics – Cosmology (Feb. 14: ACCEPTED for Ph.D via website, Feb. 15: Official offer for Ph.D via email + $11.5k Half Predoctoral Fellowship + $11.5k/9 month TA) :D This was my 2nd response and 2nd acceptance!!! I was very lucky. Very nice research in physics (specially in time), beautiful campus, but doesn't have as good reputation as UA, so I declined the offer. Thanks UCONN!!!
:arrow: Oklahoma - Physics - Cosmology (Mar. 09: ACCEPTED for Ph.D via email + declined before an official offer was made) :D I was contacted to know if I was still interested before the official offer was made. I decided to go to UA, so I declined the offer. Thanks OU!!!

WAITLISTED

:| Ohio State - Physics – Cosmology (Mar. 15: Waitlisted via email) :) It is great to be waitlisted by such a great program, this was on my top 3. Told them to keep me out of waitlist because I had already accepted UA offer, but still got a rejection letter on Apr. 11.
:| U Wyoming - Physics - Research Interest (Apr. 01: Waitlisted via email) :lol: I was announced that I had been waitlisted along with the rejection email on Apr. 01. This was an ultra top safety University...well at least now I know I won't be eaten by a bear.

REJECTED

:!: UNC-Chapel Hill - Physics - Cosmology (Feb. 17: Rejected via website) :? First rejection...didn't hurt, but I can't understand why got rejected.
:!: Brown - Physics - Cosmology (Feb. 22: Rejected via email; Feb. 22: Rejected via website) :? Offer to apply MS, no Ivy League for me.
:!: Northeastern - Physics – Complex Networks (Feb. 23: Rejected via website) :shock: This was my top safety university.
:!: Vanderbilt - Astrophysics - Cosmology (Mar. 03: Rejected via website) :roll: Well...thought I would make it.
:!: Penn State - Physics - Cosmology (Mar. 09: Rejected via email) :wink: Great university and my top application, I expected this.
:!: NYU - Physics - Cosmology (Mar. 15: Rejected via email) :? Great cosmology group, I am happy of not having to live at NY though.
:!: Notre Dame - Physics - Astrophysics (Mar. 17: Rejected via website) :roll: Well...beautiful campus though.
:!: NCSU - Physics - Astrophysics (Mar. 28: Rejected via website) :shock: Safety university, cosmology is way better than astrophysics.
:!: Utah State - Physics - Field Theory (Mar. 28: Rejected via email) :shock: Another safety university but very small, that makes it harder.
:!: Minnesota - Astrophysics - Cosmology (Mar. 29: Rejected via website) :? This was a very nice program, but still wasn't in my top.
:!: UMass - Amherst - Physics - Fundamental Interactions (Apr. 07: Rejected via website) :? I thought I would be at least waitlisted.
:!: Purdue - Physics - Cosmology (Apr. 10: Rejected via website) :wink: This was expected, but I don't care.
:!: Pittsburgh - Physics - Cosmology (Apr. 18: Rejected via website) :lol: Terrible website, I find out I was rejected on June 23th!.
:!: Arizona State - Physics - Cosmology (Apr. 21: Rejected via email) :P My new rival!. UofA is way better than ASU.
:!: UC Riverside - Physics - Astrophysics (May. 16: Rejected via email) :shock: This was unexpected, but I don't care now.
:!: Rensselaer PI - Physics - Astrophysics (Jun. 01: Rejected via website) :roll: Hideous application, finally it's over.

NO RESPONSE

:?: UW-Milwaukee - Physics - Cosmology (Apr. 17: No response, neither by email nor website) :? Applied on Jan. 30. Answer, I paid!.

OTHER

:x Michigan State - Physics - Research Interest (Dec. 27: Tried to apply) :evil: Lost my TOEFL and GREs scores. They didn't care.
:x SUNY-Buffalo - Physics - Cosmology (Dec. 27: Tried to apply) :evil: Lost my General GRE scores and told me to send them again.
:x FSU - Physics - Research Interest (Jan. 15: Tried to apply) :evil: Didn't accepted my official transcripts (sent from another continent).


I am extremely happy about how things went, I was able to enter to one of my top 3 dream universities. I was very lucky that I was accepted in my first two responses, I didn't had to deal with the stress and anxiety of the first rejection. I am also glad that I didn't had to choose between two of my top 3 universities, I consider myself extremely blessed for this. If I had to do the process over again I would do it with a little more of time, specially being an international student. The truth is that, for international applicants, this is a very hard, exhausting, and quite expensive process, so be aware of that if you are considering to apply to the USA. I would like to thank my sisters, who obtained their Ph.D.s in important universities in the USA (UIUC & UW-Madison), and who helped me a lot for my application process. I hope my experience will help you through this process, wish you success, and my advice for new applicants is:

"Apply with all your effort or do not apply, but do not just try."
