Type of Student: Domestic white male

GRE Scores:
Q: 750 (82%)
V: 590 (84%)
W: 4.0 (45%) :?
P: 770 (68%)


Research Experience:
2 years studying non-equilibrium critical phenomena using Monte Carlo simulations; led to award winning poster presentation at a symposium and a first-authored paper in PRE. Currently studying random Boolean networks; 2 papers and a senior thesis in progress. 1 summer studying anthropological data using signal analysis.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions:
Goldwater scholarship
Outstanding first year student in the Honors College

In case there are jazz fans reviewing my apps: I've played jazz piano professionally 2 nights a week throughout my undergrad career.

Special Bonus Points:
Not much here... 2/3 of my letter writers are well known in their fields; the letters themselves should be pretty good. Hoping that graduating in the Honors College helps (or else I've wasted many hours and a few hundredths of a grade point).

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:
Personal statements and related essays should be pretty good.
The crappyness of my college will probably matter to some of the upper-echelon schools I'm applying to.

Undergrad Institution: Small, regionally known liberal arts school. No national physics reputation, but 2-3 faculty members are significant contributors to their field (including my recommenders)
Major(s): Physics, Philosophy
Minor(s): Mathematics
GPA in Major: 3.7ish (4.0 for A+/A, 3.6 for A-)
Overall GPA: 3.6ish
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: #1 in physics, top 10% overall
Type of Student: Domestic White, first of my family to graduate college (heard this was important)

GRE Scores:
Q: 800
V: 790
W: 5.0
P: 770 (700 on retake, after 2 years out of school: I doubt this hurt; most places accepted my self-reported 770 until after the decision was made)

Research Experience: 1 year of polymer research, 3 years astrophysics research at university, 1 year as part of an international collaboration. 1 summer at a major research university (top 5) under PI of a major collaboration. Paper published in major journal, second author. Another 2 years went to my senior thesis, which is close to publication (though probably not before applications are due). All research in CMB polarization simulation and analysis, with the exception of the first year.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Full scholarship to university, physics award for most likely to succeed (from university). Lots of small little research grants (my research was always paid).

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: tutored for 3 years in college, TA'd a class senior year, and taught for 2 years after school at a public high school. SPS treasurer, worked pretty hard on getting funding (first (and so far only) time SPS gained independence from funding through the department).

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: I'm really hoping that my publication and summer spent at Chicago boosts my application. I was really heavily involved in things in college, so lots of things on my CV--leadership potential? Plus 2 years of teaching shows an aptitude for TAing.

Special Bonus Points: First to graduate from college in extended family, from a rural mid-atlantic upbringing, should have 3 very strong recommendations, including one from a top contributor to the field from a major university. I am also footnoted as a reference in 2 philosophy articles and a book chapter I was asked to look over by a philosophy professor, though I don't know if that's worth mentioning in my SoP.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I spent 2 years thinking about grad school. I'm very certain this is what I want to do, and it shows in my application.

Applying to Where: For all, I indicated astrophysics and particle physics simulation/analysis as my research preferences.

Top 10:
Stanford-Physics (Church)rejected (2/24/2011)
Chicago-Physics (Bruce Winstein (he will be missed), John Carlstrom, Wayne Hu) rejected (3/2/2011)
Berkeley-Physics (Holzapfel, Lee, Smoot) rejected (3/14/2011). Response to email.

Top 20:
U Michigan-Physics (Huterer, Evrard, Freese) rejected (3/15/2011).
UT Austin-Physics (Komatsu)--Waitlisted 3/5/11withdrawn
U Maryland-Physics (Center for Fundamental Physics) rejected (3/15/2011)
U Washington-Physics (ADMX)-- withdrawn
UCSD-Physics (Keating, Paar) 23k (3/4/11)--offer declined

Top 40:
NYU -Physics (Hogg, Blanton, Scoccimarro)rejected
UC Davis-Physics (Knox, Bradač)Accepted-- 28k (2/14/11)OFFER ACCEPTED: WILL ATTEND
UCSC-Physics (Blumenthal, Aguirre) rejected (3/15/2011). Response to email.
UC Irvine-Physics (Cooray, Bullock)Accepted--30k (2/4/11)--declined

Top 60:
Case Western-Physics (Ruhl, Shutt & Akerib, Starkman)Accepted--23K/yr TA (2/11/11)--offer declined
Pittsburgh-Physics (Kosowsky, Zentner) Accepted with fellowship, 28K/yr, 2K personal expense accnt(2/7/11)--offer declined (2/20)


NSF GRFP--nope.

EDIT: I think I was good enough to get in to most of the places on this list past the top 10s. My previous experience, however, is very extensive in a particular branch of astrophysics (CMB). My acceptances basically followed the pattern of yes from schools who had active CMB groups, no from everyone else. I wasn't married to CMB personally, but I guess I turned out to be professionally.

Also, my publication didn't seem to matter to anyone. Professors I met with were much more interested in the 2 REU's I did that I didn't publish in.

Undergrad Institution: top 20 or so in physics
Major(s): physics, math (+ masters degree), music (+ masters degree)
Minor(s): I got too many majors already
GPA in Major: 3.95, slightly lower in math/music
Overall GPA: 3.9
Length of Degree: 5 years for 2 undergrad degrees + 2 masters degrees
Position in Class: top?
Type of Student: domestic female

GRE Scores:
Q: 800 (94%)
V: 720 (98%)
W: 4.5 (67%) :oops: can't write under time pressure to save my life
P: 860 (82%)

Research Experience: three summers, all in HEP-ex - one in Germany, one at an ivy school, one at CERN. Internal publications (one of many many authors) inside large collaborations.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: award for being the (one of two) most outstanding graduating senior from math department; the usual blahblahblah: Dean's List, school scholarship, blah...

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: tutored in chemistry

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: I was a fiend in time management, and I have amassed an insane amount of credits.

Special Bonus Points: grad classes in math + a year of grad QFT. A bunch of A+'s in physics classes which may look good on transcript but do not repair my GPA. Female? One rec letter from a famous prof in my field of interest from whom I took classes and did well; other rec letters from profs I done research with, and should be very good.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I have a bachelor and a masters degree from a major music conservatory. Don't know how much that would hurt me in the application - I might appear to lack focus in life :(

Applying to Where:
all for hep-th, with interest in hep-ex

Stanford - accepted via email on 2/23, two year physics departmental fellowship - Will Attend!
Berkeley - accepted via email on 3/3, standard TA affair + $1500/year fellowship for 6 years
MIT - accepted via email on 2/2, $2400/month fellowship for the first 12 months
Princeton - rejected via email on 2/17
Columbia - accepted via email on 2/23, 5-year fellowship
Harvard - accepted via email on 2/17, all first-years get Purcell fellowship for ~$2519/month for the academic year
Chicago- accepted via email on 3/1, TA for $20,700 / 9 months + RA $2300/month for at least two months in the summer
Cornell - accepted via email on 2/8, TA + 4k fellowship for the first year
U of Washington - Seattle - accepted via snail mail postmarked 2/9, TA ~$1800/month + 5k first year scholarship - offer declined 2/17

For future applicants: I really thought my PGRE is too low for a theory applicant, and I am pleasantly surprised by the results... Based on conversations during open house visits and the "recruitment" efforts from the professors, my background in hep-ex and secondary interest in hep-ex are what got me a foot in the door in some places and the fellowship offers in some others. If you apply on theory only, your mileage will vary.

Been Lurking for a little bit. A little embarrassed about my profile but, whatever.

Undergrad Institution: Top 100 School Overall, Unknown in Physics (Probably not very high)
Major(s): Physics, Mathematics
Minor(s):
GPA in Major: 3.38
Overall GPA: 3.44
Grad GPA: 3.50
Length of Degree: 4 undergrad, 2 grad
Position in Class: Near Top
Type of Student: Domestic Male, Underrepresented Minority

GRE Scores:
Q: 790 (91%)
V: 580 (82%)
W: 5.0 (84%)
P: 590 (29%) Nov 2009, 640 (41%) Nov 2010


Research Experience:
1 Summer REU at home institution, Atmospheric Physics
1 SULI at Argonne National Lab, HEP-Ex, deep inelastic scattering of electrons from carbon target
1 SURF at Yale University, HEP-Ex, jet identification and cataloguing from p-p collisions
1 SURF at NASA, Atmospheric Physics, cloud climatology of mid-atlantic region
Senior Thesis, Cirrus Cloud Uncertainty and Clobal Climate Model accuracy
No undergrad publications

2 Years MS research at home institution/NASA, expanding undergrad research into satellite and instrument network validation
2 publications expected by end of program (April 2011)

Awards/Honors/Recognitions:
Honors Program
Cum Laude Grad
MS Fellowship from NOAA
Outstanding Physics & Astro student, 2008
SPS-VP

Pertinent Activities or Jobs:
TA through outside program
3 year undergrad research assistant at home Inst,
(mostly doing non-intensive research, i.e. grunt work)


Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:
Took a couple of grad courses in physics, atmospheric physics as an undergrad, made A's in the physics courses, B's in the atmospheric physics courses

Special Bonus Points: Minority, expecting a strong recommendation from mentor at Yale, strong recommendation from respected string theorist at home inst, strong recommendation from atmospheric physics PI

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Hurricane Katrina victim, family still has not recovered financially, worked part time throughout all of undergrad as research assistant, also held outside part time jobs so that I could eat, medical problems (partially torn ACL) really hurt my later grades.

Applying to Where: All for HEP-Ex

Pie in the Sky (Recommenders, mentors, and advisors keep telling me to apply to these places, I don't know why.):
MIT - Application Withdrawn
Stanfordl - Application Withdrawn
Princeton - Rejected
Yale - Rejected

Not Impossible (but still unlikely):
UMD-CP - Application Withdrawn
JHU - Application Withdrawn
Brown - Application Withdrawn

Still working on safeties (which I think I will need a lot of), will update when I finish research into them. As you can tell, I'm not planning on getting in any places. I may do another Masters in HEP-Ex somewhere, or simply go take some undergraduate/graduate courses.

Update: So... some sort of way my application made it to Applied Physics program of University of Michigan - Ann Arbor, I will be attending in the fall with a 5-year tuition fellowship and about $30,000 in stipend. I guess it just goes to show, you never quite know where you will end up and you never quite know how you will get there. IMHO this is probably one of the most surprising results I have seen on this board.

Undergrad Institution: Top 5 public school
Major(s): Physics, Math
Minor(s): N/A
GPA in Major: 4.00, 4.00
Overall GPA: 3.87
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: Top
Type of Student: Domestic white male

GRE Scores:
Q: 800
V: 670
W: 6.0
P: 970
Math: 880

Research Experience: 3 REUs, one in experimental nonlinear dynamics, one in condensed matter theory, one in algebraic topology. Publication submitted for the one in condensed matter theory, publication in preparation for algebraic topology. Did a year in a condensed matter theory group starting sophomore year, and then have been working in a mathematical physics group since junior year. No publications from either, though.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Random scholarships and local awards.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Was an undergrad TA for differential equations for a semester.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: President of my social fraternity for 2 years? That's about it.

Special Bonus Points: I know all of the professors giving me recommendations quite well, and I think they will be pretty good. Strong connections to Caltech, UC Berkeley, and Harvard. I also came in with no AP credit but took a ridiculous number of classes every semester so that I could graduate in 4 years with two majors (and I'll actually be graduating with more credits than necessary). I've taken a handful of graduate level classes too: in quantum mechanics, classical mechanics, general relativity, differential topology, algebraic topology, commutative algebra, and algebraic geometry. Also, I'm applying to both math and physics programs, depending on the school. Finally, I've done quite well in the Putnam exam every year.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Misdemeanor charge for drug possession freshman year.

Applying to Where:

Berkeley - Math - Mathematical Physics
Caltech - Math - Mathematical Physics

Undergrad Institution: Big state school - great physics program (Top 20? 50?)
Major(s): Physics & Astronomy
Minor(s): Russian
GPA in Major: 3.97
Overall GPA: 3.98
Length of Degree: 4 Years
Position in Class: Near top?
Type of Student: Domestic White Male. No diversity whatsoever

GRE Scores:
Q: 900
V: 540
W: 5.0
P: First time: 660 (46%) Second time: 680 (50%)

Notice GPA vs. PGRE score. It should be interesting how this affects where I get into...


Research Experience:
Have been doing summer research since junior year of high school. Four summers at NASA GSFC and one random research position at a university. Not REU. Two years of part time research during school year. Unfortunately no publications. Bunch of stuff is in progress, but nothing published.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions:
Various university scholarships. Nothing too big. Probably will graduate Magna Cum Laude

Pertinent Activities or Jobs:
None, other than my research experiences.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:
Native Russian Speaker

Special Bonus Points: I have three very solid letters of recommendation. Two from research mentors, one from professor who I've taken two classes with.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:
I did research my junior year of undergrad with a professor that I did not ask for a letter of recommendation. I quit the research because I did not like it, so I felt it would be in my best interest to not ask him. However, the research still shows up in my transcript and essays, so I am not sure if admissions committees will consider this positively or negatively.
Also, lots of A-'s on transcript. A's and A-'s count the same towards GPA at my university.

Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): None
GPA in Major: 4.0
Overall GPA: 3.96

Position in Class: Not sure, but probably pretty high
Type of Student: Domestic white male

GRE Scores:
Q: 800
V: 680
W: 5.0
P: 750



Research Experience: REU + semester research at MIT (I go to school in Boston, so I am able to do research during school), three different small projects at my own school, independent study at UIUC, highschool mentorship at Fermilab. No publications.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Goldwater Scholarship, honors society and departmental honors at school

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Three years as a math/computer science tutor and grader

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

Special Bonus Points: One of my recommenders is my PI from my MIT research position.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: My early research was in astrophysics, but the later stuff in is nanoscience.

Applying to Where:

MIT - Physics - Rejected :cry:
Harvard - Applied Physics Rejected
Cornell - Applied Physics Rejected
Stanford - Applied Physics - Rejected
Columbia - Physics Rejected
Univ. of Maryland - Physics - Accepted 2/24

Undergrad Institution: Seven Sisters School
Major(s): Physics, Astronomy
Minor(s): None
GPA in Major: 3.97 in Physics (one A-), 4.00 in Astronomy
Overall GPA: 3.85
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: Top in department, Top 15% in whole class year (only ranking my school does)
Type of Student: International (South Asian) Female

GRE Scores:
Q: 750 (82%)
V: 540 (73%)
W: 5.5 (94%)
P: Retained for now

Research Experience: 2 rather prestigious summer REUs

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Institutional merit-based scholarships all 4 years, Sigma Pi Sigma, expecting to graduate magna cum laude

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Have held loads of little on-campus jobs (fills more than 50% of my resume), but the only relevant one is TA/Grader for several intro and intermediate classes since sophomore year

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Took classes at four different schools in total, loads of electives (undergrad level), got recommendation from one of those profs, have rather unusual extracurricular accomplishments (though lack of community service),

Special Bonus Points: VP of SPS, involved in major department in various ways, pretty multilingual, professional teaching experience (math), national recognition for an international math test in high school, recommenders all love me,  4.00 GPA in Fall semester (not all schools will get to know that). retty interesting “Diversity Statement” in the schools that required them, professors know people in a couple of the departments I am applying to, one of my recommender is currently one of the top 10 women in her field (though unrelated to astrophysics). As in all relevant major classes except one (where I got an A-).

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Did not ask for a recommendation from the last research adviser, very little research experience compared to most people, mediocre grades in math classes, some issues with the Physics GRE. GPA shows an upward trend from a rather devastating first semester GPA. Lived in three different countries, speak English like a native.

Applying to Where:

UC Santa Barbara - Physics
Brown - INVITED FOR PHONE INTERVIEW
UT Austin - Astronomy - ACCEPTED 1/13
Yale - Rejected via website

Research Experience:
Two summer research projects, one of them in a very prestigious institute in my country
One minor publication in an obscure journal
Working on final year project at home university

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: UG education was funded by government scholarship

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: none

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: can't think of any

Special Bonus Points: One reasonably famous (in cond-mat community) recommender

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Length of degree is a major problem at a lot of places

Applying to Where:

University of Michigan - Physics - Cond-mat theory accepted via unofficial email 1/17 - dept. fellowship+0.25 GSI (declined 3/22)
Cornell University - Physics and Astronomy - Cond-mat theory accepted via email 2/9 - $24k/9mo. TAship (declined 4/12)

Rutgers University - Physics and Astronomy - Cond-mat theory Waitlisted via email 3/2
University of Wisconsin, Madison - Physics - Cond-mat theory rejected via email 2/9 (!)
Yale University - Physics - Cond-mat theory accepted via website check 2/4, univ. fellowship+TAship @ $30k/12mo. (declined 4/12)
SUNY Stony Brook - Physics and Astronomy - Cond-mat theory accepted via email 3/22 - $21.5k/year stipend (declined 3/25)
University of Maryland - Physics - Cond-mat theory rejected via website check 4/14
University of Kentucky - Physics and Astronomy - Cond-mat theory application withdrawn 2/22

Moral of the story:

I think the most notable point in my application was the length of degree (3 years). Lot of univs have rules against taking students with such a degree (the reason I didn't apply to UCSB, Stanford, Chicago,...). However, my experience shows that this can be overcome by having an otherwise-good profile (GRE scores help a lot I guess). Still, I had to work a lot with the bureaucracy to go from *recommended for admission* to *actually admitted* stage, particularly at Berkeley, Michigan and Stony Brook. So if you are an Indian with a 3-year BSc degree, I'd say go ahead and apply, grad schools will bend all rules if they really want you...

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: no formal physics education

Applying to Where:

UCSC - Astro - exgal - REJECTED

U Toronto - Astro - instrumentation + planets - REJECTED
U Washington - Astro - exgal, astrobio - REJECTED
U Arizona - LPL - planets - REJECTED
JHU - Astro - exgal, cosmo, planets
______________________________________________

At the end of the day my choice to not retake the PGRE hurt my application. Despite working on possibly some of the most exciting research projects in astronomy today, Universities could not get past the PGRE. If you are an international student and are interested in exoplanets get a good score there is no way around it.

I will now suck it up, buckle down and study - next year is my final attempt at grad school...

Undergrad Institution: Asian. Ranked in the top two in my country and with name recognition across the region, but not well-known in physics abroad.
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s):
GPA in Major: 3.97
Overall GPA: 3.65 -- I didn't do as well as I should have in my freshman year, but managed to average ~3.8-3.9 in the past two and a half years
Length of Degree: 5 years
Position in Class: top
Type of Student: international male from a country with a very, very small applicant pool

GRE Scores:
Q: 800 (94%)
V: 670 (95%)
W: 4.5 (67%)
P: 850 (80%)


TOEFL Total: 113/120 (iBT)

Research Experience: Two major research projects in all. Two years of theoretical research, with a thesis and two first-author publications in preparation. Second project on completely unrelated observational/computational field, but with no publications as yet. Lots of in-class independent papers and projects on such topics as numerical linear algebra, PDEs, classical mechanics, solitons, field theory, and photonic crystals.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: cum laude candidate, an award from a big government institution for my undergraduate research, several appearances in the Dean's list, and an undergraduate merit-based scholarship

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Organizer of physics seminar/lecture series

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: I do some creative writing on the side (not that you can tell from my AWA score). Nothing relevant for physics though.

Special Bonus Points: Fairly large number of math and mathematical physics classes (e.g., differential geometry, PDEs, abstract algebra, and a lot of math methods classes) taken. Recommendations should be excellent. Also, my country doesn't send a lot of strong physics applicants to the States--the rate is like one strong app every 2-3 years.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I used to major in a non-science field for a year before switching to physics, which explains why it took me five (admittedly well-spent) years to finish my degree.

__________________________________________

It is finished! Near-perfect scores on the PGRE and GRE aren't strictly necessary to get into top schools. Evidence of self-motivation (be it in grades, self-study, or research) is far more important. Among the top 10 schools I applied to, I noticed I got into the ones to which I wrote in close detail about a prof's research that interested me, and rejected by the schools where I struggled to write in detail about the research at the school that interested me. The lesson is the research interest portion of your SoP can be the feather that tips the balance in your favor.

GRE Scores:
Q: 800

Research Experience: 4 years, 1 prof, with a few other profs overlapping. Refereed publications already out and more in progress. Conference poster.

Awards: Goldwater, some scholarships, a few other awards.

Pertinent Jobs or Activities research, outreach

Any Other Info That Might Matter: ?

Applying to Where: All physics, all experiment, subfields depended on school's offerings

MIT - Accepted
Berkeley - Accepted
UCSD - Accepted
UCLA - Accepted
UCSB - Accepted
Harvard - Accepted
Stanford - Accepted
Caltech - Accepted

NSF - awarded

Note: Brought back by popular request. BTW, a male classmate got into MIT with a PGRE in the low 60s. Another male classmate got into Cornell, full fellowship, with a score not much better. No joke. I don't understand the obsession with test scores. Those scores are only useful for the year in which people apply to grad school. Research/publications are useful for a lifetime. But, regardless, I originally thought mine was too low, even for experiment - definitely was not expecting to get in everywhere.

Good luck to everyone in later years.

Research Experience: I did 4 full years of preparation and research in string cosmology, including a SURF and one summer spent at ICTP in Trieste, Italy. Working on an honors thesis now. No formal publication yet, maybe at the end of the year something will be written.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: 6 various kinds of scholarships within my school, including a SURF grant and a study abroad grant, and a foreign language award in Latin (for what it's worth).

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Worked at BAE Systems Inc. in an optics lab for 3 summers before going to college. Member of SPS and PME. Worked at my university's math help center for two years.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:I'm writing a mathematics textbook on pure math for advanced high school students.

Special Bonus Points: I've taken several graduate level physics courses (general relativity and cosmology, intro to string theory, and grad quantum), and graduate level math courses (smooth manifolds and diff. geometry, intro to lie groups, logic, and grad topology). Getting a recommendation letter from the director of ICTP, who's research I am contributing to.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:I do a lot of independent reading outside of class, and random special projects: one on fluid mechanics, one on gauge symmetry.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:
I'll just include the next 3 things in here. I'll be graduating with 2 degrees, a B. Sci in Mechanical Engineering and a B. Sci in Physics and Math, which is why I need the minor in history interestingly enough. My cumulative GPA is low because of general education courses taken my first few years when I worked 30 hours a week (this should have been mentioned in my letters, it was unrelated to my SoP and was advised not to put it in). I have a 3.74 cumulative GPA the past 108.5 credits. I'm going to graduate with 192 credits. I've used 5 different imaging/data reduction packages through my research and another 3 through course work. I observed using a research grade telescope during my summer REU

Applying to Where: All in some sort of Radio Astronomy or Instrumentation combination (alphabetically)

Arizona - Rejected
Berkeley - Rejected
Columbia - Rejected
Hawaii - Accepted Declined
Maryland - Rejected
New Mexico - Accepted Declined

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Non-ideal records and GRE scores.

Applying to Where:

>> TIER 1
U Hawaii at Manoa - Astronomy - Observational Astronomy and Astrometeorology
U Arizona - LPL - Solar System [REJECTED Feb 9 via E-mail]
U Texas at Austin - Astronomy - Observational Astronomy [REJECTED Mar 8 via E-mail inquiry]

U Central Florida - Planetary Sciences - Solar System

>> Safeties
Wesleyan U - Astronomy - Observational Astronomy (Master's)
U Kansas - Astronomy - Observational Astronomy

Note (Mar 19) I really looked forward to go to Hawaii, but after waiting for over two weeks for their respond to my application inquiry I choosed Western (as most likely it would be a rejection from Hawaii). So you see that GRE/GPA are important, even you can work (mostly) all by yourself to a few publications on premier journals. After all, I am happy with the Western acceptance. They have a nice program that fit my academic interest well. Good luck to everybody on getting in his/her dream school.

A note to future applicants: as you can see I did a rather extreme approach. I have spent most of my time to research (since my 1st semester) and end up with bad grades and poor pgre. That being said I always believed if you have your ideas and passion, don't get restricted to anything. I missed a lot of classes to attend colloquiums and seminars, but I never regret. Of course being balanced with research and also classes would be very safe, but no pain no gain. You have to take the risk, put everything you have in what you think is awesome and challenging. If you want to be exceptional, then BE exceptional.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: The only grade I had in college that wasn't an A was Calculus 2; I got a B. The rest (including my upper-level undergrad physics classes) have been A's.

Applying to Where:

Just for laughs:

MIT - Physics - Rejected by email, 2/28 *
Princeton - Plasma Physics - Rejected by email, 2/3

* They had the wrong email address for me, for some reason. I didn't find out about it until exactly a month later. :x

More reasonable:

Univ. of Iowa - Physics - Accepted by letter, 2/14; confirmed by website, 2/17; rejected their acceptance by letter, 3/21
Univ. of Florida (UF) - Physics - Rejected by email, 3/8
Florida State Univ. (FSU) - Physics - Accepted by email, 2/24

Summary: Student from (basically) a no-name school with all A's (except for one B). Okay GRE General scores; not-so-great GRE Physics score. Two summer internships: one at University of Florida, one at MIT. No publications, but presented a poster at an APS-DPP meeting. Pretty sure letters of rec are positive. Never got around to making someone look at my statement of purpose, and I've never read one before (except my own). Missed some deadlines due to poor planning (University of Texas - Austin, University of Wisconsin - Madison).

Master's Institution: Arguably the top Canadian school, depending on who you talk to
Major(s): Experimental High Energy Physics
GPA in Major: 4.00
Overall GPA: 4.00
Length of Degree: 2 years
Position in Class: Tied for top, I guess
Type of Student: Ethnic Canadian Male

Master's Qualification Institution: Same as Master's
Major(s): Physics
Overall GPA: 3.88
Length of Degree: 1 year

Undergrad Institution: Another Canadian school; others argue that this is the top school
Major(s): Engineering Science (Physics Option)
Overall GPA: 3.12
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: Just below the middle

GRE Scores:
Q: 800
V: 640
W: 5.5
P: 620

Research Experience:
- MSc thesis in experimental particle physics
- Several months working in the operations group of a major particle physics experiment
- Course based research project
- Summer research project
- Member of the author list of major particle physics collaboration (~9 publications, though none are based on my own work)

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: A few small university fellowships, some major national scholarships when I was an undergrad.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: TA for a couple of years. Had a lucrative career as an engineer for three years after undergrad.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: I had to do a self-funded graduate qualifying year before my current institution would allow me into their MSc program.

Special Bonus Points: A bunch of grad classes, most of which are relevant to hep-ex. I've been in the "real world" and have transitioned back into academia (though this might be frowned upon).

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I'm currently a proofreader for a soon-to-be-published quantum textbook. Also, my undergrad GPA is teh suck.

Applying to Where:

I decided to avoid applying to US schools, mainly because I wanted to study outside of North America. Also, my PGRE score is weak. Profile might be useful for those thinking of studying abroad, or for those who have been out of school for a while.

McGill - Physics - Experimental Particle Physics Accepted March 11th via application portal - Declined

I took time off between undegrad and applying for graduate school to serve in Teach For America. If I had it to do over again, I would have taken the physics GRE my senior year instead of waiting and then trying to prepare after two years away from physics. I was expecting a lot of disappointments after I got my scores, but things worked out surprisingly well.

Physics GRE Score: 520
GRE Quantitative: 800
GRE Verbal: 720
GRE Writing: 5
Undergrad Institution: Medium sized state school, not outstanding reputation, but not bad either
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): Mathematics
GPA in Major: 3.8+
Overall GPA: 3.9+
Position in Class: near top
Type of student: female non-minority domestic
Research Experience:
REU in molecular biology, led to conference talk
Honors thesis research in biophysics for 1.5 years, led to conference talk
Positions or Jobs:
After graduation:Teach For America corps member.
While an undergrad: volunteer math tutor at high school for 2 years, SPS president, physics tutor, physics lab TA.
Awards/Honors/Recognitions:
Amgen Teaching Fellow (national), state research grant, Phi Beta Kappa, Sigma Pi Sigma, graduated summa cum laude
Bonus Points?: Letter writers have connections at UIUC and my institution sends quite a few students there. Does a strong background in biological sciences and biochemistry count as bonus if you are going into biophysics?
Physics Field(s): Experimental biophysics

Applications
Vanderbilt University-Chemical and Physical Biology: offered interview 1/18, interviewed 2/11, accepted 2/15, fellowship offer
University of Michigan-Biophysics: offered interview 1/26, interviewed 3/18, accepted 3/22, fellowship offer

Applying to Where: everything hep-th

Harvard-Stanford-Columbia-Cornell-UCB-UCSB: Rejected

Moral of the fable: hep-th is a very competitive subject. Play well your chips when choosing unis, be aware that for an international and even for an american it is very hard to get in hep-th in a top uni. There are a lot of great students around the world, and most likely there are many that are better than you (and me), and with better connections. Spend as much time as necessary looking in spires for the work of the faculty members at each institution before deciding where to apply. Good luck!

I was here two years ago when applying for a PhD but decided to leave my program with an M.S. and apply to schools primarily in Europe (where often the M.S. is the required threshold) as an American. This is a rather unusual thing to do, but I'm posting it in case there are other "domestic" students out there trying to think outside the box!

M.S. Institution: Technical University in the USA well-regarded in Physics
Field: Physics, astrophysics concentration
GPA in Major: ~3.0, passed the qualifier
Length of Degree: 1.5 years
Position in Class: average
Type of Student: female from the USA

Undergrad Institution: Same as the M.S. university
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): History
GPA in Major: ~3.0
Overall GPA: 3.26
Length of Degree: 4.5 (semester abroad got in the way)
Position in Class: average
Type of Student: female from the USA

GRE Scores: I didn't take them this time around (as European universities don't need them, but from two years ago I think it was something like this...
Q: 720
V: 670
W: 5.5
P: 12th percentile because I am awesome

Research Experience: A great REU my last summer of undergrad in radio astronomy, and at my university I worked on and off for a HEA professor for 5 years (including my senior thesis and M.S. thesis), built a radio telescope with the Ham radio club on campus

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Service Award from the Physics Department, an award from the National Association of Science Writers to attend AAAS

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: TA'd for a year, heavily involved with the Physics and Astronomy Club, lots of public outreach (such as doing the Science Cafe in my town one month)

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: I do a lot of writing and science outreach and in fact currently do freelance work for various pop science magazines (Astronomy, Discover, that ilk)

Special Bonus Points: Was in the physics department but took a few astronomy courses along the way even at the graduate level, very strong letters of recommendation as I am close to all my letter writers

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I'm not a good student academically because I'll do the homework but am awful at test-taking, so my transcripts are all over the place.

Applying to Where:

USA:
Columbia - Astronomy - rejected upon inquiry
Boston University - Astronomy - rejected via email
UC- Santa Cruz - Astronomy - rejected via email

Europe:
Oxford - Astronomy - Radio Astronomy rejected via email
Edinburgh - Astronomy - Experimental Astronomy interviewed 3/18 via Skype
St. Andrews - Astronomy and Physics - Experimental Astronomy never heard back :?
Imperial College - Astronomy and Physics - Experimental Astronomy rejected via website
Leiden - Astronomy - Radio Astronomy waitlisted 12/15
University of Amsterdam - Astronomy - Radio Astronomy interviewed 4/29 via Skype, accepted 5/9, will attend
MPI- Heidelberg - Astronomy - High-Energy Astrophysics rejected via email
MPI- Munich - Astronomy - Experimental Astronomy rejected via email
MPI- Bonn - Astronomy - Radio Astronomy interviewed 1/27 via Skype

Needless to say it's been a crazy past few months, but here are a few notes for anyone considering throwing a few darts into Europe:

1) No one needs the GRE over there, which is great if yours was as bad as mine, but you usually need a M.S. to apply. It is also free to apply and everyone's ok with non-official transcripts until you're admitted (the exception to both counts being Oxford) so this alone is a good reason to apply I think!
2) I found English-speaking programs for physics/astronomy in the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and Switzerland. On "the Continent" your citizenship doesn't really matter when it comes to funding but in the UK the majority of their funding is pretty much reserved for UK residents (though EU citizens can have their tuition fees covered, ie no stipend) unless it's from the European Research Council in which case all nationalities can apply. Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh, and Manchester were the big schools I found in Europe who had consistent opportunities for international students.
3) The interview was really important as they use this to gauge your knowledge in the field etc in lieu of having a Physics GRE or whatever. It took a little bit of getting used to as I'd never done one before but definitely be able to talk about basic concepts you learned in your classes and prepared answers for the basic questions... While I liked having an opportunity to have a say in the application process there are definite downsides to it as well, as I think I would've preferred an outright rejection compared to learning for example it was between two people for one position and the other guy got it.
4) Grad school varies place to place but as a general rule you need the M.S. because you are considered done with classes and just focusing on research for your PhD, which will last 3-4 years (some schools make you TA a bit just due to a lack of warm bodies, but it isn't expected to take more than 20% of your time). Stipends vary too- in Holland for example you are classified as a junior employee of the university instead of a student, so in addition to incredibly nice benefits (full medical insurance and five weeks vacation anyone?) I get pay that is similar to what a post-doc makes in the USA and increases each year.

So that's been my little forray into the other side of the pond :) Really recommend it as some of the world-class research is focused in Europe, and feel free to PM if you have any questions about applying there.
