Undergrad Institution: State flagship, in top 25 in physics
Major(s): Engineering physics
Minor(s): Computer science concentration
GPA in Major: 3.9
Overall GPA: 3.8-3.9
Length of Degree: 4.5 years
Position in Class: In 90th percentile I'd say, judging by test scores/grades
Type of Student: As white male American as they come

GRE Scores : revised
Q: 164 (89%)
V: 168 (98%)
W: 5.0 (95%)
P: 700 (54%)

Research Experience: One Summer research scholarship at home institution, in solid state experiment. Poster presentation. No publications. Am doing another year-long research project in same lab.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Research scholarship from school. Two memorial scholarships (alumni endowments) about 3k, one state scholarship for ~5k

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Tutoring math/physics, both for pay and as a volunteer. Physics demonstrations at science museum. Gave a few talks to incoming freshmen on research participation. Significant programming experience in C++, C#, OOP methods.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: I mentor the children of refugees. I doubt I'll mention this, one shouldn't try to capitalize on good deeds.

Special Bonus Points: ???

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I'm 31, more mature than the average undergrad, and am serious about this.

Applying to Where:

U. Texas Austin - Physics - Gravity and relativity Rejected. Not surprised.
Penn State - Physics - Gravity and relativity Rejected
U Florida - Physics - Gravity and relativity/mathematical physics Rejected. Gravity is tough to get into I'd say...
UT Dallas - Physics - Gravity and relativity Accepted, TA/RA $1800/mo. tuition covered
UNC Chapel Hill - Physics - Gravity and relativity Rejected on April 9th
Baylor - Physics - Gravity and relativity Accepted, Presidential Fellowship + health insurance, will attend!
UT Brownsville - Physics - Gravity and relativity Program canceled apparently

Advice: Research the schools you're applying to. Research the profs you want to work with and mention them in your SOP. State your research interests but realize some areas (like gravity theory) are hard to get into. Spend a few months preparing for the PGRE. I was unable to study for health reasons and got a 700 where I know I could do 900+.

Having the right advisor is much more important than the ranking of the school.

Caltech - Rejected 3/11

UCSB - No longer interested

Here's my advice to future applicants, particularly internationals:
COME PREPARED!
I had only decided to apply to universities in the US two months before the final PGRE date this year. This had thankfully not damaged my PGRE score, but much of my application must have looked half baked to the decision committees at the very top schools. Specifically, despite my very substantial research experience (over 7 years, including extensive research in CMT), I have failed to publish anything of value in peer reviewed journals. Though most of my research could not be published due to proprietaries of sorts, I could publish at least a few papers if not for my utter laziness. Sure, my recommendations were all by researchers I worked with, and they were very strong, but they still didn't worth much as I did not have the papers to back them.
Frankly, despite my satisfying scores and statistics (and my M.Sc) , I should consider myself extremely fortunate to be admitted to a top 10 school for CMT.

Stony Brook - Physics - Accepted to Masters Program 3/13 via email.

Reflections...

i was shocked when i got my first acceptance from columbia. Because of my pgre (despite having retook it, it wasn't as high as i hoped), i thought i'd be lucky to get into brown. but i guess they are very important in the end, as the boston powerhouses saw through the facade of my LORs, statement of purpose, etc. and stony brook.. apparently i was as qualified to be admitted to PhD but they just didnt have enough money. boohoo

in the end, i still hold firm to the belief that connections and networking can go a long way. your grades can be stellar, pgre may be average to stellar, but without the right professors saying the right things in their letters, it can still be hard to accepted to top programs. so my advice for future applicants is: get involved in research deeply, both in an academic and interpersonal level (get to know the professor as he/she will hold a big portion of your potential to be accepted into phd programs). study for the pgres and take them seriously. like legit like youve never taken anything seriously before.

Undergrad Institution: Oxbridge
Major(s):Physics
Minor(s):N/A
GPA in Major: 82%

Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: near top
Type of Student: White/Hispanic - As a Spaniard I can never decide between the two

GRE Scores :
Q: 166 93%
V: 162 89%
W: 4.0 54%
P: 910 87%


TOEFL Total: I'm not actually a native speaker, but luckily they don't ask for this to UK graduates.

Research Experience: 2 months on Quantum Optics Theory. First author in a publication just submitted (will not be accepted on time I'm afraid).

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Some small College Scholarships within my school, a couple of semi-big prizes in my home country (I'm EU but not from the UK).

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: I went to a great Uni at a country different than mine, I hope that matters as an international applicant. Given how hard it is to do the PGRE in the UK I am assuming they don't get too many applicants from there.

Special Bonus Points: My recommendations are (I hope) my strong point, I wouldn't be the first nor the second one they put in one of the top places. Also my Master's project is quite state-of-the-art and directly related to what I am applying to.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Nah, I just hope my not so great GRE scores do not hurt me a lot (910 is definitely not enough for top HET). I did not prepare them seriously and did not sleep the night before the physics one (I was travelling to get there - It was in the most remote place in England).

Applying to Where:

Princeton - Physics - HEP Theory Rejected 02/14
Harvard - Physics - HEP Theory Rejected 03/04
Caltech - Physics -HEP Theory/Cosmology Rejected 03/11
UCSB - Physics -HEP Theory/Cosmology Rejected 03/11

PSI - Accepted 03/04 - Declined
Cambridge Part III - Accepted 03/20
Imperial - Quantum Gravity - Interview 02/21 Rejected 03/08
Kings College London - HEP theory/Cosmo Rejected 03/21
UCL - Quantum foundations/Quantum gravity - Accepted 02/22 - Will attend!

Update: Not that I wouldn't have been rejected otherwise, but it looks like HET in the US is going through some tough times funding-wise, so beware, prospective applicants! http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=6701

Long time lurker, first time poster. Hope this is helpful for people who, like me, have less than stellar profiles.
______________________________________________
Undergrad Institution: Public university in Spain
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s):
GPA in Major: 7/10
Overall GPA: 7/10
Length of Degree: 5 years on paper, it took me 6 (to put in into perspective, only one person in my class graduated in 5 years, and only two of us did it in 6, the rest are taking 7 or longer)
Position in Class: Near top
Type of Student: International female, hispanic (I don't know if that's considered a "minority", but most applications ask explicitly, so I guess it matters for some reason)

GRE Scores : Revised
Q: 165 (91%)
V: 165 (95%)
W: 4.0 (54%)
P: 790 (71%)


TOEFL Total: 117 (30 R, 30 L, 28 S, 29 W)

Research Experience: One summer at a university in London with a research scholarship (we don't have REUs or anything like that) in Quantum Information theory. No publication.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Several scholarships through my undergraduate career

Pertinent Activities or Jobs:

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: I can run a sub 4 hour marathon? I know it's kind of silly and not really an accomplishment, but it might show discipline and commitment, so when applications ask about extracurricular activities or things like that I mention it.

Special Bonus Points: My supervisor in London gave me a few names of professors to get in touch with and I've had positive feedback. I haven't taken any graduate classes per se, but my undergraduate included classes such as Quantum Field Theory or General Relativity which sometimes I've seen referred to as graduate level, I don't know. Also female and hispanic (does that really help?)

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:

Applying to Where: A bunch of places because I'm scared I won't get accepted anywhere. Some are way out of my league and I know I'm throwing away my money but hey, I want to hear it from them. All for Quantum Information/Computation or AMO (related to QI/QC):

Florida International University - withdrawn
University of Maryland Baltimore County - accepted 2/7 via email, $23,100 TA for 12 months - declined
University of Central Florida - withdrawn
Oklahoma State - withdrawn
Tulane -withdrawn
University of New Mexico - accepted 1/29 via email, $15,196 TA for 9 months + possibility of TA/RA during summer - declined
Louisiana State - accepted 2/5 via email, $22,000 for 12 months graduate assistantship - declined
Dartmouth - accepted 2/11 via email from potential advisor, Dartmouth fellowship $27,720 for 12 months - declined
Colorado State University Fort Collins - I sent the pre-application and they're supposed to tell you whether they recommend you send the official application; I never heard anything back (so I'm assuming unofficial rejection) but I'm not interested anymore
University of Southern California - accepted 4/10 via email, $30,000 merit award for first year - WILL ATTEND!
University of Rochester - rejected 2/13
Texas A&M - withdrawn
Georgia Tech - accepted 3/18 via email to check website, $24,060 TA for 12 months - declined
Pennsylvania State - withdrawn - unofficially accepted - professor I'd mentioned in application emailed me after withdrawing to tell me I was selected for admission and ask me to reconsider - declined
University of Maryland College Park - rejected 2/9
Caltech - rejected 3/11

Takeaway for future applicants
I'm really happy with how things turned out. I was pretty anxious about applying, due in part to the advice that I had read on this forum (for instance that people with GPAs like mine don't usually get accepted anywhere...). That's why I applied to 16 schools. Then I started getting offers and withdrew a few. My GPA is terrible by American standards (between 2.8 and 3.1 depending on how you convert it), my PGRE was nothing to write home about, and I only have a few weeks of research experience, yet I still managed to get into several places, including a couple that are ranked in the top 30 (not that I think ranking is incredibly meaningful, but I've seen people saying that some higher ranked schools have unofficial cutoffs for GPA or PGRE, and that they don't look at the rest of the application if you don't meet those). Of course I can't speak for all schools, but the ones that accepted me must look at other things like LORs or SOP. So I'd like to encourage future applicants who might not feel very confident about their profiles, or think they're not good enough. Don't take it too seriously when people seem overly pessimistic, apply to schools that are good fits for you, and there's probably no need to spend the time and money it takes to send 16 applications!

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: TA on a freshman course.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: -

Special Bonus Points: A lot of master's courses, also in math.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: -

Applying to Where:
All physics, all theory, all with a mix of HET/CMT/QIT.
Listed in alphabetical order, not preferential.

Caltech - Rejected 3/10
Harvard - Rejected 2/28
MIT - Rejected 2/18
Stanford - Rejected 2/24
Stony Brook - Accepted 3/12

PS. In retrospect, dissapointed that all the elite schools rejected me, I thought I would have gotten into one or two of them, but delighted to go to Perimeter to work in a very interesting group on a topic already familiar to me. PI sounds like a fantastic environment and thanks to the more European style degree structure I should graduate 1-2 year faster than I would have in the US because I already have a master's.

Uni. College London   : Phy & Astro - Astrophysics / Cosmology & Particle Physics - Accepted (20 May) - will go! :D



Analysis:
All US schools come with final decisions. When you get rejected, then that's all, no more negotiations. Normally if it takes you too long to get a reply, it probably means you're rejected. I got rejected by Toronto not only for the PhD course, but also the Masters. For Imperial, I was notified that I was rejected some time in April when I asked them. The reason was that they require a Master's degree first, and I do not qualify for it.

NUS called me up for an interview some time in February. I was told that if I would consider another field, I might get a higher chance of getting in. So after some negotiation and an interview with a prof, I was given a condensed matter theory project (although I have taken zero amount of solid state modules). I really think that my acceptance here is based on relationship, as I know the graduate committee personally, and he likes me as a good student.

Edinburgh had wanted to give me an offer, but they hesitated since they weren't able to provide me funding (sad life of international students). They only gave me the offer after I said that I was shortlisted for funding from my home government.

Conclusion:
In summary, I was rejected by all US schools and the only Canadian school I applied. Possible reasons might be due to low GRE scores (as a foreign student), lack of research background, and also the government shutdown earlier that year. I was initially rejected by UCL, but I managed to get funding from the Malaysian government to study there. Thus, I will be going to UCL!

Personal note: receiving multiple rejection letters within 3 weeks, is a very very very depressing thing. Be mentally and emotionally prepared for the worst!

Note to international students: Firstly, don't overestimate your qualifications. I have a good second upper, but I have zero chance of getting into even the top 23rd US school in the world. I have a classmate with a good first class honours, but the best school he could get is into Maryland, so don't expect too much. Secondly, don't underestimate your chances in the UK Universities. Sometimes they reject you because they do not have funding from their own university. If you are able to prove that you can get funding from your own home government, your application might be reconsidered again. Best wishes to all! :)

Cornell Accepted via E-mail 2/6. 26k TA+ possible summer work option .
UChicago Rejected 2/5 via website.
UIUC rejected via E-mail 3/28

Reflections:
GPA and PGRE scores are important, but you might need something more... publications, rec letters, and fellowships/grants.

Don't be worried if you don't get a 1st author paper on nature or something though. I believe most undergrads don't have a nature 1st author paper on some fancy relaxation process of Graphene. Of course, if you do, then you can send it to MIT and get an admission offer.

Try to get rec letters from a professor that is in the field you are interested in. I believe the more specific the fields are, the better it is. (I.E. when applying to Harvard Quantum electronics, try to get a rec letter from a professor who works in the field and is well known so that they would know who your prof is in person.)

Also, get fellowships/grants beforehand- schools won't have to worry about funding when they admit you.

Good luck everyone!

The final response was something along the lines of, "Well, it doesn't look like you're on our list, so you probably won't get an offer of admission." This was in late March.
UC Santa Cruz - Physics - CM/Neurophysics - REJECTED
UC Berkeley - Physics - CM/nanophysics - REJECTED (this was my pipe dream school)
NYU - Physics - CM - REJECTED
Johns Hopkins University - Physics - CM - REJECTED
University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill - Physics - CM Withdrew
Vanderbilt University - Physics - CM Withdrew
Brown University - Physics - CM - REJECTED after e-mailing to request application status

(Edit on 7/17/2014) I'm happy to finally to be participating in this great website! Here we go:

Undergrad Institution: Medium-sized state school with little reputation for physics
Major(s): Physics & Mathematics
Minor(s): None (was music at one time)
GPA in Major: ~3.5
Overall GPA: 3.63 (Cum laude)
Length of Degree: 4.5 years (music courses ate up some time)
Position in Class: Near-top
Type of Student: White male, domestic

GRE Scores : Revised
Q: 155 - 61% :?
V: 158 - 78%
W: 4.5 - 78%
P: 550 - 19% :lol: (I have retaken both GRE tests with little success…other than empty application merit, I refuse to believe they count for anything)


TOEFL Total: N/A

Research Experience: One year in experimental materials physics; learned a variety of laboratory methods such as FTIR and DMA. Two years in theoretical soft-matter physics; spent a lot of time working with LAMMPS (molecular dynamics). One first-author publication on non-equilibrium phase transition theory and poster presentation at a conference in Sydney, Australia. Was a speaker at an undergraduate mathematics conference on modular forms and their applications to string theory and black hole information. REU participant for 1 year (home institution).

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Graduated with honors; received a variety of department/university scholarships (few hundred dollars here, a thousand there) in both physics and music. Dean's list for two semesters (and *just* missed it on two other occasions :x ).

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Tutored physics for one semester and calculus for one semester. Was a paid undergrad assistant.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Won the student concerto competition at the school of music, open to both undergrads and graduates (has to count for something).

Special Bonus Points: One of my recommenders is a well-known soft matter theorist.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Hmm…I consider my personal statements to be well-written. Got As in my advanced mathematics courses (partial diff EQ, differential geometry, advanced calc).

Applying to Where:

Yale - Physics - Condensed Matter (Theory) Rejected by Email
U of I Urbana - Physics - Condensed Matter or Astrophysics Rejected by Email
Carnegie Mellon - Physics - Condensed Matter or Astrophysics Rejected by Email
Indiana University - Physics - Nuclear Astrophysics Rejected by Email
Washington University (St. Louis) - Physics - Condensed Matter or Astrophysics Waitlisted on 04/09/14 …but at that point I had already decided to not take my chances and accepted FSU's offer.
Florida State - Physics - Condensed Matter or Nuclear Astrophysics Accepted on 2/20/14 at $21,900/year + $1000 Scholarship for 1st semester! WILL ATTEND!

Looks like I pulled through (with scratches)! I hope this gives hope to those who hate standardized tests...make it big in your research, grades, and networking, and you don't really have to worry about going to a good school : )

Undergrad Institution: Big state school, OK physics rep
Major(s): Physics, Applied Math
Minor(s): Chemistry
GPA in Major: Physics :3.82 /Math: 3.96
Overall GPA:3.66
Length of Degree: 5 (did 2.5 years of chemistry before switching to phys/math)
Position in Class: a prof told me I was considered top 2 out of about 50
Type of Student: Domestic/Female/Half Puerto Rican

GRE Scores : revised
Q: 159 (75%) :cry:
V: 158 (78%)
W: 4.0 (54%) :x wtf
P: 780 - dude, I cant exam for crap, and I am at peace with it



Research Experience:
1) photochemistry - 1 year - no pubs - chem dep
2) nonlinear dynamics - 1 year and on going - 2 manuscripts - math dep (prof took off so no recent work on it)
- first project was athe non linear Schrodinger and I did a large portion of the work +manuscript in preparation (might get 1st author)
- second project on bose einstein condensations, multiple talks on my work as well as awards + manuscript in preparation (will be first author)
3) Computational biophysics - 1 summer - no pubs
4) On going theoretical work on HTSC


Awards/Honors/Recognition: graduating with honors etc. nsf travel award, honors thesis award, huge school scholarship for research, in SPS/PME, featured university student, poster presentation award

Pertinent Activities or Jobs:
I am the historian of PME, I am involved in a lot of outreach and I have recently started my own organization for organizing campus-wide outreach events

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: University has a profile of me and my work on a number of websites and it is the first result when you google my name. Also have videos up of my lectures, etc.

Special Bonus Points: I'm female + hispanic + first generation. Audited two graduate courses and using them in my current work. I have connections to three of my schools. Two know me personally from conferences and the other is the almamatter of one of my advisors and I am applying to work with his advisor

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: started college at 16, have a lot of programming skills listed, a lot of outreach again.

Applying to Where:

Failures:
Harvard - Physics Department - CM/TP - Rejected
Duke - Mathematics Department - Applied - Rejected
Stanford - Physics Department - CM/TP - Rejected
UCSB - Physics Department - CM/TP - Rejected
Columbia - Physics Department - CM/TP -Rejected
Yale - Physics Department - CM/TP -Rejected
Perimeter Institute - Masters Program - Rejected

Success:
Stony Brook - Physics Department - CM/TP - Accepted! 25.5 k + fellowship CMT _ Almost attended
New York University - Physics Department - CM/TP- Accepted! Two fellowships ->45k ....total disbelief. Definitely considering
Old Dominion U - CMT/Nuc - Accepted

Grants:
NSF GRFP -CMT - VG/VG, E/E, VG/E Awarded! 32k/year for 3 years + tuition + travel ops + supercomputer access.

Let's be real here for a second: the Non-Ivy -> Ivy/top10 transition in theory is damn near impossible. In addition to that, physics is getting more competitive: only two students from my year made it into graduate school despite the good physics rep my university has. Last year a lot of uni's over admitted and now the entire graduate ecosystem is a mess. People who should have gone on to Stanford, etc. this year ended up in lower ranked schools, displacing the students who would have been accepted there, etc. I'm grateful for the offers I did get considering my physics GRE and the fact that I got a B+ in Thermo/StatMech. I clearly have promise as demonstrated by my NSF award and I will likely use it to my advantage to get into a better Ph.D. program down the road. Future non-Ivys .... please work hard and do better than I did on the GRE and make sure that you have a publication to lean on in admissions. I think those were my two major drawbacks this season


~~~~~~~~~BUT WAIT~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After winning my NSF GRFP award I asked a few schools for reconsideration. While almost all of them ignored me or had a policy against it:

UCSB - Physics Department - CMT - ACCEPTED! Not only do I have guaranteed support beyond my NSF grant plus an additional fellowship, but my PI of choice soon emailed me and offered me a position in the fall. LIFE. IS. SO. GOOD WILL ATTEND!!!!

There is hope after all for non IVY students!!!!! TOP 5 GUYS!!!!

Undergrad Institution: Small liberal arts college
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s):
GPA in Major: N/A - my school doesn't do grades
Overall GPA:
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: N/A - no grades and tiny school
Type of Student: Domestic female

GRE Scores : (revised or old version?)
Q: 168 (97%)
V: 167 (98%)
W: 4.5 (78%)
P: 670 (47% - all of you people who are dissatisfied with scores in the 800+ range are killing me)

Research Experience: Worked in a well-funded lab at my school over the summer of my junior year, turned this research into undergraduate honors thesis.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: A few merit-based scholarships in undergrad, but I doubt that the graduate committees care much.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Physics and Chemistry TA, Research Assistantship (see above), Robotics TA at a summer camp, some computer programming experience (Java and Python)

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: I'm well-rounded and good at writing?

Special Bonus Points: At least two of my recommendations should be really strong - going to a tiny school means that you get really well acquainted with your professors. I'm a female, which may help my application - but I would resent anyone who implied that I got into a school only because of my gender.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Like I said, my school is tiny and gives narrative evaluations instead of grades. I'm not sure if this will help my application (we're a good school, just weird, and send a lot of students to graduate programs) or hurt it (the fact that I don't have grades and did poorly on the PGRE could be an issue).

Three of my five schools don't require the Physics GRE (Rochester, RIT, and UBC).

Applying to Where:

UW Madison - Physics - Quantum Computing - 2/6 Rejected by email (bummer, but probably not the best fit anyway)
UNC Chapel Hill - Physics - Biomedical - Rejected 3/20 with an email to check the website
University of Rochester - Optics - Biomedical - 2/24 Rejected from Ph.D. but offered M.S. with a 50% tuition waiver
Rochester Institute of Technology - Imaging Science - Biomedical/Historical Document - 2/24 Accepted with $20,000 TA for the first 9 months and possible summer stipend
University of British Columbia - Physics - Biomedical

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: tutored in my physics department my senior year

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

Special Bonus Points: female applicant.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I think my statement of purpose is pretty damn good, but then again maybe everyone does. I'm not afraid of humanities courses and I think that makes me a well rounded person? (not sure if that even matters) Also I know some programming but every physics major should, right?

Applying to Where:

I'm applying for astrophysics. I will share as I hear.

University of Minnesota - rejected 1/28
University of New Mexico - rejected 1/29
UW Madison- rejected 3/5 Astronomy 3/6 Physics
Boulder- rejected APS and Physics Departments
UNH- Accepted for PhD with funding!
New Mexico Tech- rejected

Undergrad Institution: Ivy
Major(s): Physics
GPA in Major: ~3.8 (hand calculated, not submitted)
Overall GPA: 3.72
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: Above average
Type of Student: White Domestic Female

GRE Scores :
Q: 166 (93%)
V: 163 (91%)
W: 5.0 (93%)
Note: My only preparation was one practice exam
P: 690 (52%) :!:
Note: Major Junior year illness, see below

Research Experience:

- 3.5 years at home institution including 2 full-time summers doing instrumentation design in experimental astrophysics (one side project in coding a data reduction program)
- One poster presentation on work to be presented Summer 2014, no publications (and so goes instrumentation work...)
- Planned to do a LIGO SURF REU at Caltech during my Junior year summer but illness kept me from attending. I completed a project plan with my Caltech mentors in preparation for the internship and noted this in my statements.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions:

- Annual departmental award for excellence in undergraduate research in Astronomy (my Junior year)
- Dean's list most semesters (throughout undergrad)

Pertinent Activities or Jobs:

- Undergraduate teaching assistant in physics
- Physics tutor
- Various outreach initiatives with Astronomy department and SPS
Note: I stressed an aptitude for and interest in teaching in my SOP


Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

- Four leadership positions in a national co-ed, co-disciplinary honors fraternity (not in greek system, my Freshman and Sophomore years)
- Some independent advocacy for disabled students on campus (my Freshman year)

Special Bonus Points:

- Female
- Two semesters of graduate level QFT with letter from my first semester QFT instructor, a hep-th prof
- Additional graduate class in hep-th second semester Senior year
- Course in GR tied in nicely with interest in gravitational wave detection and letter from my major advisor who is in gravity theory
Note: Astronomy concentration within Physics major, related elective laboratory course, and work within Astronomy department gave me a good general knowledge of Astronomy which was illustrated in SOP
Note: I highlighted my leadership and interpersonal skills in my SOP. I also mentioned a burgeoning interest in theory, which Rutgers mentioned they liked
Note: I only got straight As (I include A-s in that, though) since my Sophomore year, which is a nice upward trend on my transcript

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:

Illness: This was a doozy. From end of second semester Junior year through to the start of my Senior year, I was fighting bronchitis and then pneumonia as a severe asthmatic. I was unable to stand up for longer than 1-2 minutes from June-July, and in August before my Senior year it took me two weeks of physical training to be able to walk normally again. I never imagined I could be that sick. I had to take incompletes in three courses and missed my summer internship at Caltech. Because I needed to make up finals, see ~9 different doctors and 4 different specialists, and get so much rest while completing graduate courses, GREs, and 13 applications, my PGRE score took a major hit. I thought it would ruin me, but I still got into a top-5 university which was a big surprise to me. I did not illustrate the severity of my illness in my SOP like I am here, but I did submit a brief and concise statement of illness along with my SOP and had a Dean from the college write a letter on my behalf. I hoped the schools could connect the dots and realize my PGRE was lower than it would have been. Just now in February I'm beginning to regain the health I had before the illness -- if I could give any advice to those reading this forum in the future, it's to please take care of yourself and realize how critical health is to your career. I pushed through far too much (aka, using my nebulizer in the bathroom 2x/day between classes), when I should have just taken three weeks off and healed properly. It would have saved everything in the long run. While I did learn a great lesson from this, and I still did very well this application season, I believe I could have done even better if I kept up my health and was able to boost my PGRE by ~150 points where it belongs. That said, I was shocked how little it matters if the rest of your work and the familiarity of your undergrad institution is up to par. So if your PGRE is low, regardless of circumstance, apply widely, apply confidently, and see what happens. You might be surprised. I know I was.

Applying to Where:

Primary interest: Experimental Cosmology/Astrophysics

Brown - Physics - Accepted 2/24 via email, $30k/year - Declined 4/1
Caltech - Physics - Accepted 2/20 via email, $30k/year GRA - Will attend!

Stanford - Physics - Rejected 2/24 via email
UPenn - Physics & Astronomy - Accepted 1/24 via email, TA $29k/year + opportunity for Summer 2014 research position - Declined 4/4

NSF GRFP - Awarded 4/1!

A last comment is that because of my illness I was forced to do a "depth" and not "breadth" course in my undergraduate research. I think the fact that I was doing independent graduate level work at my home institution with a professor who very much liked me was helpful both in my SOP and via his recommendation letter. So, I would say that if you're doing good work in your field, don't worry too much if you don't have a variety of experiences in research.

Last last comment for those who are starting this process next year: I never in a million years had the confidence or the perfect scores displayed in these profiles, but I just kept truckin' along and seeing what would happen. And I did better than I ever imagined when I was on the other side of things. So hang in there, class of 2015 :)

I used the previous years' threads in deciding where to apply and scaring myself looking at other people's results. Now it's my turn.

Undergrad Institution: I suppose I'll stick with my classmates in calling it a big state school with a top-tier rep in physics
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): None
GPA in Major: 3.75
Overall GPA: 3.63
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: Everyone around here seems to be above-average, the department doesn't tell us what our rank is
Type of Student: Domestic white male

GRE Scores : (revised)
Q: 170 (98%)
V: 166 (96%)
W: 6.0 (99%)
P: 970 (92%)


Research Experience: 2ish years in a particle experiment group on campus, no publications

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Not really

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Graded for a QM class

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Not really

Special Bonus Points: Grad course in QM, shouldn't this be combined with the "Misc. Accomplishments" thing?

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I was dealing with some personal issues during my sophomore year which led to bad grades in two math classes, which I explained in my essay. I later retook the classes and got As, and the rest of my math classes are As-B+s. One of my letters is from one of those math professors (when I got an A, not when I flunked).

Applying to Where:

All physics departments, I indicated a primary interest in HET but with additional leanings towards CMT, QIT, gravitation, basically anything but experiment. I'll update the list as the results come in.

UC Irvine - Accepted 1/24 by email. ~$18000 TA + $10000 Chancellor's Fellowship for the first two years, attended visit day 2/21. Will attend!
U Chicago - Rejected 2/5 by website
Wisconsin Madison - Rejected 2/6 by email
Yale - Rejected 2/10 by email to check website
Michigan - Rejected 2/13 by email
Princeton - Rejected 2/14 by email
MIT - Rejected 2/18 by email
UC Berkeley - Rejected 2/20 by email
Stanford - Rejected 2/24 by email
UCSD - Rejected 2/28 by email
Harvard - Rejected 3/1 by snail mail
Columbia - Rejected 3/10 by email to check website
Caltech - Rejected 3/10 by email
UCSB - Rejected 3/11 by email
UCLA - Rejected 4/24 by email to check website

Take away message: HET is hard. Be very afraid. At visit day UC Irvine said that they only admitted 5 students who indicated an interest in HET, and as luck would have it I'm one of them.

Undergrad Institution: Ivy
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): Mathematics
GPA in Major: ~3.6
Overall GPA: ~3.6
Both major and overall GPA closer to ~3.8 in the last four semesters
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: I think I hold my own within a brilliant group of students. Research wise, I think I might be the most accomplished student in my year.
Type of Student: Domestic female

GRE Scores : (revised or old version?)
Q: 168
V: 162
W: 5.0
P: 760

TOEFL Total: N/A
Research Experience: I did one summer in a condensed matter experiment group at my home institution.
I started working with my current research group winter of 2012 working in a small collaboration focusing on theoretical and computational research on topological insulators. I did independent studies with my group junior year and am working on my senior thesis this year (a total of 4 credits). I did a Materials REU at my home institution working with my current group Summer 2012.
Last summer I worked on a paper with my research group at my institution and did an REU at a top fifteen school, working on a project in CMT. My summer advisor and I are currently finishing a paper resulting from the REU. I will be first author and will most likely be submitted to Phys Rev B.

First author publication in Phys Rev Lett published the week of January 20th (giving a talk on this work at the APS March meeting) I am also working on my senior honors thesis.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Named science award from university (provides full tuition and fees) given to students in the physical sciences for achievement in the classroom and in research. This award requires me to write an honors thesis and earn an M.S. (will be getting an M.S. in physics as well when I graduate this year)
Award for best paper in chemistry for the Materials REU at my home institution

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Member of APS, research honors society on campus, student advisor for the physics major

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: I like to read physics textbooks and papers for fun so I have learned a lot from that. It has helped me in research and do really well in grad quantum without having taken undergrad quantum.

Special Bonus Points:
I think my research experience is incredibly strong. I have dedicated most of my time to my home group but have also had other experiences. My four recommenders all know me very well so their recommendations should be outstanding. They are all extremely well connected. I think my statements were very strong because they were very specific and informed
I have taken eight grad classes including two semesters of grad quantum, one semester of QFT, and stat mech among others.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: My PGRE score was very disappointing. For future test takers, eat breakfast and make sure you read the questions carefully so you don’t misinterpret them. It makes the process much less stressful if you do well on the PGRE so take it seriously.
Grades are not as strong as they should be mostly due to inconsistent exam performance which for the most part got much better in the spring of sophomore year.

Applying to Where: All for CMT, also interested in AMO and Quantum Computing research related to CMT

CU Boulder – Accepted 2/17 by email with a $10,000 signing bonus
UC Berkeley - Rejected 2/25 from the website
UChicago – Accepted 1/22 by phone and received the Nambu Fellowship $44,500 for three years!!! Unbelievable!!!
Cornell - Accepted 2/5 by email with a $26,285 teaching fellowship
Harvard - Accepted 2/13 by email with the James Mills Peirce Fellowship that comes with an extra $18,000 given over the next three years. Will Attend!!! So excited!!!!!
Illinois – Accepted 2/9 by email
Michigan – Accepted 1/23 by email with a $27,900 stipend provided by the Physics Departmental fellowship
MIT-Rejected 2/18 by email
Rutgers- Accepted 2/11 by email with an Excellence and Torrey fellowship for a stipend of $29,000 and no formal duties for the first year
Princeton - Rejected 2/14 by email
UC Santa Barbara - Rejected 3/11 on website
Stanford - Accepted 2/24 by email I thought this was the most unlikely one!!!

Advice to future applicants: Make sure to get involved with research early and find a research advisor who will both promote you and push you beyond your comfort zone. Get to know your professors, the professors at my university have all been wonderful mentors. Study hard and get good grades. However, even if you get a worse grade in a class than you hoped for, it doesn’t mean that you can’t understand the course material at a very deep level later on. Understanding physics takes time, and in the end building physical intuition is more important than getting the A. If you really understand physics, it will eventually come through.

Undergrad Institution: Ivy, top 10 physics
Major(s): Physics, Mathematics
Minor(s): Astronomy
GPA in Major: ~3.9
Overall GPA: ~3.9
Length of Degree: 4
Position in Class: Idk
Type of Student: Domestic asian male

GRE Scores :
Q: 169
V: 168
W: 5
P: 860


Research Experience: One summer doing carbon nanotube spectroscopy, one year doing extragalactic stuff, ~1.5 years on time-domain astronomy in the Galactic Center, 1 REU at MIT Haystack Observatory on temperature trends in the upper atmosphere. 3 Conference presentations, and a paper or two in the pipeline.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Dean's list

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: I was a undergraduate TA for a semester

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

Special Bonus Points: (Such as connections, grad classes, famous recommenders, female or minority status etc...) I took on pretty diverse research projects and managed to get meaningful results in most of them. I think 2 of my recommenders are pretty well connected. As per coursework, my 1st semester in college was my worst semester by a fair margin, so I showed some upward trend. I also took two grad courses and did decently in them.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: My personal story is pretty unconventional, but I only put it down for schools that required a separate personal history statement (UC Berkeley and UC Santa Cruz).

Applying to Where: I put down my primary research interest as data-intensive astronomy, but I mentioned pretty broad research interests beyond that.

UC Berkeley - Astronomy - Accepted via phone on 01/29
MIT - Physics - Accepted via email on 02/10
Harvard - Astronomy - Interviewed via Skype on 01/27 --> Rejected via snail mail
Stanford - Physics - Rejected via email
Columbia - Astronomy - Accepted via email on 02/10
Princeton - Astrophysical Sciences - Rejected via email on 01/23
UW Madison - Astronomy - Waitlisted via email on 01/30
Caltech - Astronomy - Interviewed via Skype on 01/30 --> Accepted via email on 02/03
UChicago - Astronomy - Rejected via email on 02/06
UC Santa Cruz - Astronomy - Interviewed via Skype on 01/29--> Accepted via email on 02/07
UM Ann Arbor - Astronomy - Accepted via email on 01/30

And so ends my admissions journey. Getting interviewed then rejected by Harvard was a bit odd (I thought the interview went well), but I'm definitely happy with the offers I received. I was a bit worried about my PGRE score, as I took on the last possible date with less prep than I would've liked, but research recs >> GRE according to some folk I talked to on admissions committees.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: not really

Special Bonus Points: very good relationships with research supervisors -> probably strong letters

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: pretty good idea of what I want to do but that's probably nothing special...

Applying to Where: all CME

Harvard - Applied Physics (SEAS) - $2767/month
Stanford - Applied Physics - $2936/month RA
Caltech - Applied Physics

MIT - Physics - $2637/month fellowship
Berkeley - Physics
Maryland, College park - Physics - $24,783 first year fellowship+RA

U of Toronto - Physics Masters
UBC - Physics Masters
McGill - Physics Masters

The data base was very helpful so I decided to contribute as well...
Advice:
1. Try to do well on the GREs because they do matter and there is no reason why you should underprepare.
2. On the other hand, grad school application is really about what you have done throughout your entire undergrad, so choose the right schools and have faith in the good work you did in the last few years :)
3. Talking to professors from the schools you apply to may or may not have an effect on your application result (more likely no, so don't stress if you didn't have lengthy correspondence with professors from your dream schools. I had none). But it is a good idea to ask if certain profs are taking new students if you are interested in their groups.
4. Relax...

Undergrad Institution: Ivy
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s):
GPA in Major: 3.98
Overall GPA: 4
Length of Degree: 4
Position in Class:
Type of Student: american female

GRE Scores :
Q: 168
V: 168
W: 5.5
P: 990



Research Experience: 1 summer at a national lab studying magneto-hydrodynamics. 1 year of research in AMO-x at home institution

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: nothing at a national/international level, so nothing that really matters

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: TA

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

Special Bonus Points: grad classes including GR, atomic physics, QFT. nothing else really.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: One letter was from a well-connected prof in AMO-x, whom I did research with. The others weren't research letters, so they probably didn't matter.

Applying to Where: AMO-X, pure physics

MIT - Accepted, $32k fellowship
Harvard - Accepted
Princeton - Accepted, $36k Centennial fellowship
UCSB - Accepted for CME, TA/RA + $6k Broida and Ferrando-Fithian fellowships
Maryland - Accepted, $36k
Boulder - Accepted, TA/RA +12k signing bonus
Berkeley - Accepted

Good luck to all future applicants! Just some tips:
1. Take the GRE seriously. With appropriate study (~10 hours/week for 2 months for me) you can definitely get above 900. Also consider taking it in your junior year or earlier--get it out of the way.
2. Don't worry if you don't have any papers/publications, although they'd definitely help if you are first/second author. I don't think they make a difference if you're, for example, 10th author. Just make sure you have one strong LOR for research.
3. If you're not sure which subfield to choose, apply to the subfield of your strongest letter writer. They have the most relevant connections to the people reading your file.

My turn to help the current/next gen applicants:

Undergrad Institution: (School well known for Engg. in India, has good physics faculty too. My seniors in physics went to places like MIT, UIUC etc.)
Major(s):Electrical Engg.
Minor(s):
GPA in Major: 7.9/10 :oops:
Overall GPA: 8.1/10 :oops:
Length of Degree:4
Position in Class:Not sure, but not the top
Type of Student: Over-represented International male

Grad Institution:Avg. State school in the US mid-west, half-decent for Engg., relatively unknown in physics
Major(s):Electrical Engg.
Overall GPA: 3.4/4 :oops:
Length of Degree:3 (applied last year, but got nowhere. I could spend a year on my MS thesis, so took grad QM and other classes for audit, impressed the prof, and got a good LoR from him)


GRE Scores : old
Q: 790/800
V: 600/800
W: 4.0/6
P: 930


TOEFL Total: waived due to 3 years of study (will be getting a masters) from a US univ.

Research Experience: most of my undergrad electives were physics courses (too bad didn't get a minor/dual degree). Some project I did with an undergrad friend is in arXiv. (rejected from journal, but got a remark "has good pedagogic potential"). Undergrad projects in QI, quantum optics (no publications). Grad level QM and many-body courses. Masters Thesis is more of physics than engg.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: some tuition scholarships in undergrad and grad

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Tutored a few undergrads in 1st year physics

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

Special Bonus Points:2 very good LoRs from well-known people (not THE most famous, but well respected)

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Work-ex in hardware design company. Doesn't add much to my case, but my programming and electronics skills are quite good, and I tried to show them as assets in my personal statements.

Applying to Where:
Since I'm from EE, I tried to portray myself as suited for Condensed Matter experiment in all places except UCSD (CMT there).

Univ. of California, San Diego (UCSD) - Physics - Reject, March 1st Generic Email
Ohio State University - Physics - Reject, March 6th Generic email
Penn State Univ. - Physics - Reject, March 3rd Generic Email
University at Buffalo, SUNY - Physics - Admit on Feb. 11th, 16.5k TA + 4k Scholarship on Feb. 13th Contacted 2 profs in Nov 2013, one prof. replied +vely. Second prof replied in Feb 2014 saying "you may have good chance of getting in...", and I got the admit a week later.
Univ of Pittsburgh - Physics - Admit, with 24k TA , March 4th(including summer term)
Univ of California, Irvine - Physics - Reject, April 2nd- They selected only 2 out of 163 international applicants (in condensed matter?) and both had government/Fullbright fellowships apparently. (What a waste of $150 + 2 copies of all transcripts :x )
Rutgers Univ - Physics - Wait listed (March 21st), and mostly a reject.
Northwestern Univ - Physics - No reply, so I mailed them on March 12th only to get this reply: "At this time, no decision has been made on your application. We have a rolling admissions process and may accept applicants right up until the April 15th deadline. I understand you have your own decision to make, and I'm sorry I can't give you a more precise timeline." -- wtf?

Advice:
-start research early!-try to get some variety, you will not get another chance to dabble freely in different fields, don’t worry about results as much as just doing a good, thorough job because
-your LOR’s are extremely important-most undergrads are students first, the foremost indication of your research abilities comes from your LOR
-no need to stress if you don’t have experience in precisely the sub-field you are applying to-for most undergrads consistently doing good work (grades) is enough, you don't need to claim to have a well-defined career trajectory
-describe how you fit into the professors’ projects, not the other way around-try to think about what a professor would find appealing, should never be issues of "incompatible research interests"

Undergrad Institution: Well-known UC
Major: Physics / Appl. Math
Minor(s): None
Overall GPA: 3.27 before Fall grades came in to lift it to 3.38. Had a couple B-'s and one C+ thanks to a toxic personal situation and the near-foreclosure of my home (which I did not outline in any of my application materials).
Length of Degree: 4 years B.A. (+ 3 years community college for high school requirements)
Position in Class: Unknown
Type of Student: domestic white female, graduating at a younger age

GRE Scores : (revised)
Q: 161 (81%)
V: 165 (95%)
W: 4.5 (78%)
P: 660 (45%) (I took it while researching abroad)

TOEFL Total: N/A

Research Experience: Worked with a planetary science scientist at NASA for five years, culminating in a paper published last year (a physics simulation applied to cyanobacteria). Have been doing research at the space physics lab nearby (was unable to get a rec from the university professor overseeing my work as he died in my sophomore year, writing the paper now). Spent last semester collecting samples for independent fieldwork for a large scale biophysics/genetics project (which I got a grant for last month).

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Regents' and Chancellor's Scholar. Got the Research Fellowship last month.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Co-founded a company in middle school before I went to community college and accelerated my education. Resuscitated the dead SPS chapter at my school, which has gone from 8 non-active members to 90 members with a healthy set of undergraduate events. I've established inroads from SPS for students interested in teaching, research and industry through outreach and faculty/grad engagement programs. Students have told me these events changed their career, such as gaining an interest in plasma physics or meeting their research adviser.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

Special Bonus Points: My NASA adviser is world-known in geophysics. My space physics adviser was too, before he had a heart attack in his office.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I expressed my intense desire to do research, because that is what I want to do with my life - I went to community college at a young age so I could get to study physics and do research. This could have been read as overconfidence or disingenuous by world-weary profs.

Applying to Where:

MIT - EAPS - geophysics - Rejected by email 03/14 (Didn't try hard for this anyways because the profs had different interests)
Harvard - Physics - biophysics - Rejected by snail mail 03/13 (learned too late that the biophysics program has a completely separate application process)
Berkeley - Physics - experimental - Rejected by email 02/20 (pretty certain the low PGRE score killed this one; but I've observed so many bad behaviors of the faculty at Berkeley that I'm not too sad about being rejected)
Caltech - GPS - geobiology/geophysics - Rejected by email 03/13 (didn't see this one coming -- all my previous research lines up, and I didn't send them my PGRE score because it wasn't required; all I can guess is that they decided I need more experience before I go to grad school)
UCLA - physics - plasma - Rejected by website 03/05 (I knew this one was dicey with my scores, but the people I know who went there said that their score didn't matter; I had also contacted the profs before the decision was released; none responded except for one who told me to "apply to other departments")
CU Boulder - Physics - plasma/space physics - Accepted by email 02/25 + $5,000 "sign-on bonus" + faculty contact (visiting in April, very nervous since I can't see if this prof has had any prior grad students)

Also, I have applied to a program where, if I am selected, I would need to take two years out of school. The program provides funding and contacts to develop a business. This is not what I love to do, but I have the training and I am good at it. If I succeeded I would be able to support my family so my brother could return to finish school. I also would be able to finish my biophysics research project. I am worried that this would completely destroy my ability to ever come back to grad school.

Undergrad Institution: Public University
Major(s): Physics, Mathematics
GPA in Major: 4.0
Overall GPA: 4.0
Length of Degree: 5 years
Position in Class: Don't know
Type of Student: Domestic Asian male

GRE Scores : new version
Q: 170 (98)
V: 169 (99)
W: 5.0 (93)
P: 910 (87)

TOEFL Total: N/A
Research Experience: Freshman year I did 1.5 semesters of independent study with a professor and presented at the departmental undergraduate research symposium. I then did 2 summers and 2 semesters of research with an ultrafast spectroscopy lab at my home institution. This work culminated in a first-author publication in AJP. For three semesters I worked in a Biophysics lab at my home institution. I plan to write my honors thesis on this work.


Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Goldwater Scholarship, Phi Beta Kappa member, Outstanding Senior (Physics Department)

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Science outreach for three years

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

Special Bonus Points:
At the time of applying to graduate schools, I had already applied for the NSF Fellowship. I worked with my research advisor to hone the proposed research portion of the application, so he was able to write in his letter about my ability to identify a fruitful problem and formulate a research proposal. One of my letter writers was also able to speak about the science outreach work I had done with him.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I studied abroad in Germany for a year. I have never taken a Biology or Chemistry class.

Applying to Where: Mostly Biophysics

CU Boulder Physics– Accepted
UC Berkeley Biophysics- Accepted after interview visit
UCSF iPQB– Accepted after interview visit
UCSB BMSE - Accepted after interview visit
Harvard Biophysics (GSAS) - Accepted
Univ. Illinois Urbana-Champaign Biophysics and Computational Biology – Accepted
Stanford Biosciences (Home Program: Biophysics) – Accepted
MIT Bioengineering-Rejected
Columbia Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics- Accepted after interview visit
Rockefeller- Accepted after interview visit

Advice to future applicants: Do your homework on which program/department to apply to if you are interested in an interdisciplinary field. Many of the programs I applied to will let you work with professors that are not officially affiliated with the program, so your choice will mostly impact which classes you take, what kind of funding you receive, and of course, what your chances are of being accepted.

If you are interested in Biophysics, don't worry if you lack a background in Biology. Many of the professors I interviewed with also came from Physics backgrounds and learned what they needed in the course of their research.

Undergrad Institution: Ivy
Major(s): Physics, Philosophy
Minor(s): N/A
GPA in Major: 4.0
Overall GPA: 4.0
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: Unknown
Type of Student: International Male

GRE Scores :
Q: 169 (97%)
V: 168 (98%)
W: 4.0 (54%) [I was surprised - guess I can't write under time pressure]
P: 890 (84%) [I winged this in October. Stupid idea - turns out PGREs may matter a lot if you want to do theory]

TOEFL Total: N/A

Research Experience: Spent one summer working in a high energy experiment lab, another working at a plasma physics research institute in Germany. Did my honors thesis in theoretical astrophysics. No publications.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Nothing particularly outstanding.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Astronomy TA for 2 years.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Again, nothing particularly outstanding.

Special Bonus Points: Spent junior year studying abroad at the University of Cambridge. Not really a plus point seeing as my grades for that year were unexceptional - I was busy travelling around Europe when I really should have been studying for the tripos exam. Also, I spent most of my senior year taking classes outside of physics, which could have sent the wrong signal to admission committees.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I was specific about doing theoretical cosmology (CMB and Large scale structure formation) and mentioned in my SoP relevant topics and professors in each department that I applied to.

Applying to Where:

UC Berkeley - Astronomy -Theoretical Cosmology
Caltech - Physics - Theoretical Cosmology
University of Chicago - Astronomy and Astrophysics - Theoretical Cosmology
Columbia - Astronomy - Theoretical Cosmology
Harvard - Astronomy - Theoretical Cosmology
University of Michigan - Astronomy - Theoretical Cosmology
MIT - Physics - Theoretical Cosmology
University of Pennsylvania - Physics and Astronomy - Theoretical Cosmology
Princeton - Astrophysical Sciences - Theoretical Cosmology
Stanford - Physics - Theoretical Cosmology
University of Texas at Austin - Astronomy - Theoretical Cosmology

Takeaway from this Application Cycle:

Application season was not great for me this year. It could be because of one or more of the following:

1) PGREs could be better, especially if you want to do theory in a competitive field. There is no reason to do badly just because you don't remember high school optics!
2) Lack of long term research focus (and publications) in the field I ended up applying to. I wanted to explore different areas in physics that I was interested in, and didn't settle on cosmology until my senior year. Because of that, my research experience is all over the place, and I wonder if that sent the wrong signal to admission committees that I wasn't committed.
3) The funding climate for theoretical cosmology and high energy theory is not great at the moment.

Either way, I am very happy with the schools I was accepted into. Good luck future applicants!

Undergrad Institution: Big US private school, mediocre in physics, good in engineering
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): Nope
GPA in Major: 3.8
Overall GPA: 3.85
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: Out of ~10 physics majors, probably top 4
Type of Student: Plain old white male

GRE Scores : new
Q: 170
V: 167
W: 4.0
P: 820 (75% I think)

Research Experience: 2.5 years in a solar physics group without publications. Have experience as undergrad group leader and in leading training of new members. No notable results, and it's unrelated to the research I want to do

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Dean's List a bunch of times, undergraduate research financial support, Phi Beta Kappa. Nothing much else

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Some tutoring and homework grading in an official capacity for the school

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Nope

Special Bonus Points: I am taking a grad-level health physics class

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Two of my letters were really good and enthusiastic, the other was probably not.

Applying to Where:

I mostly talked about interest in experimental AMO and quantum information, although sometimes I just talked about another project that interested me. I definitely mentioned doing experiment, though.

Harvard University - Rejected
UC Berkeley - Rejected
UC Santa Barbara - Rejected
Stanford University - Rejected I had a connection here, still didn't help
University of Michigan - Rejected
University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign - Rejected
University of Washington - Rejected
Carnegie Mellon University - Presumably waitlisted by this point (4/4), still waiting to hear
University of Wisconsin, Madison - Accepted
University of Maryland, College Park - Accepted, will be attending

I got TAships and financial support and both schools I was accepted to, ~$25k/yr for two years. I thought I'd get into 3-5 schools and was a little disappointed to get so many rejections. My feeling is my application was good enough to be accepted to some other schools, but not outstanding enough that they had to accept me so people at around the same level got in. More relevant research and maybe working on more projects would probably have helped. Oh well, I really only applied to schools I'd want to go to, not any iffy safety schools. So I'm happy with Maryland. Hope this helped, looking at past ones certainly motivated me to study for the physics GRE

Position in Class: near-top, 2nd
Type of Student: Domestic white guy

GRE Scores : revised
Q: 153 – 53%
V: 154 – 62%
W: 4.0 – 54%
P: 540 – 17% - posting this for all of us that are less than Harvard-bound.

Research Experience: Senior Thesis / SCE on a custom acoustics experiment, individually presented at a large academic conference; Adv. Lab coursework presented at an academic poster-session with classmates; Currently working on R&D as technician for 1 year now, modeling/studying electrochemistry and fluid dynamics.

University of Pittsburgh – CME - rejected via their system 4/8
Ohio State University - CME – rejected via email 3/11
Ohio University - CME - most likely waitlisted, haven’t even asked. rejected 4/11
Drexel - CME - rejected via email inquiry 3/10
William & Mary - CME - waitlisted upon email inquiry. rejected 4/16
LeHigh - CME - waitlisted upon email inquiry, was contacted by their admissions coordinator, told me I was high on short list, and asked if I had retaken gre for better Q score. He told me this is the only filter they use, 70-75% range. rejected 4/21
Bryn Mawr - CME - rejected via snail mail 3/17
West Virginia - CME - waitlisted upon email inquiry.
Kent State - CME – waitlisted upon email inquiry, was “high up on their short list”. rejected 4/19


I think my selection was arguably appropriate for my gre score ranges. Hopefully this information will be much more helpful to prospectives than the current spread of results; it’s hard to extrapolate downward on this forum. Turns out PGRE really is the gatekeeper, or so it would seem. I don’t think normal GRE counts for much unless you royally screw it up, but I could be wrong. Would probably be worth gaining a few points in my case for Q.

Not gonna give up. Only fuel for the fire to study harder for that accursed PGRE.

V: 154 (62%)
W: 4 (54%)
P: 990 (94%)

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: 2 degrees in 4 years

Special Bonus Points: A good personality?

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Member of Tau Beta Pi - The Engineering Honor Society, officers for two other student orgs related to service

Applying to Where:
Basically, I applied as a general experimentalists between particle, high energy, nuclear, and accelerator physics. If a school was reputable in the area, I applied for it. (no particular order)

Michigan State - Physics - Accepted 1/16 via email. CNS fellowship, NSCL fellowship, University Distinguished fellowship $29,000/year + $1,500 signing bonus - Declined
Michigan - Physics - Accepted 1/24 via email. fellowship and quarter time GSI $2,325/month - Declined

University of Chicago - Physics - Accepted 1/31 via email to check website. $2,500/month + McCormick Fellowship $1,500/quarter + Sachs Fellowship - Declined
MIT - Physics - Accepted 2/10 via email. fellowship $2,838/month - Declined
Stanford - Physics - Accepted 2/24 via email. TA/RA $37,291 - Will Attend!!! :D

Cornell - Physics - Rejected 2/11 via email ????? :shock:
Berkeley - Physics - Rejected 2/25 via email to check website
Harvard - Physics - Rejected 2/24 via snail mail
Yale - Physics - Rejected 2/10 via email to check website

My advice, beyond what everyone is giving, is that it is possible to come from a no-name school in physics into the elites. My ME degree helped in some ways for experimental physics; however, it also hurt me in other ways. I probably could have done more research during the year. I also did not have the depth of physics course work that most students applying to these schools have; however, I made up for that with my P-GRE score. You also don't need to publish, but it certainly helps. Also, stay off this forum after you have submitted your applications. It will save you stress, just relax because you deserve it!

b]Undergrad Institution[/b]: Big State....Good (top 20) reputation in physics.
Major(s): Physics, Mathematics

GPA in Major:~3.7
Overall GPA:~3.1
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: near top
Type of Student: Domestic White Male

Q:165
V:161
W:3
P:800

Research Experience: A couple of years working in a theory group. Took a class with the PI. Working on submitting a paper. Presented at APS March meeting. Think I have at least a couple strong LOR.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: National Undergraduate Research Fellowships (paid for by major company). Some dean's list bs .

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: SPS VPres and SPS Pres

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Wrote opinion pieces for school paper for two semesters (featured topics of interest to science students)

Special Bonus Points: A good handful of grad classes with As.

Applying to Where:
I stated in all of my applications that I was interested in CMT and Biophysics theory. Tailored what I said specifically to each department.

Yale - Physics-Accepted
UCLA -Physics -Accepted
CU Boulder -Physics -Accepted
UCLA -Physics-Accepted
CU Boulder -Physics-Accepted
Oxford -Physics-Accepted
Rice - Physics-Accepted -Will Attend

Caltech - Applied Physics-Rejected
Harvard - Applied Physics-Rejected
Berkeley - Biophysics-Rejected
UChicago - Biophysics-Rejected
MIT - Physics-Rejected
Princeton - Physics-Rejected
UCSD - Physics-Rejected

NSF GRFP-Accepted....Pretty cool.

Really surprised I got into top physics programs but no interest from applied physics or biophysics which are generally perceived as easier to get into. They tend to be much smaller programs so maybe I seemed a little rough around the edges.

Even though I got into "better" schools I choose to go where I did because of specific professors in the department and overall feel of the place.

Undergrad Institution: State University (large in my state, small nationally)
Major(s): Physics, Education
Minor(s):
GPA in Major: 4.0 (kind of)
Overall GPA: 3.0
Length of Degree: 5 years to complete a degree in education, 2 more years to finish a degree in physics
Position in Class: ??
Type of Student: White male

GRE Scores : Revised
Q: 168 (96%)
V: 157 (73%)
W: 4.5 (78%)
P: 870 (82%)


TOEFL Total: N/A

So, some explanation here will probably help clarify the rest of my profile. I graduated in 2007 with a degree in secondary education. I was a high school physics teacher for 5 years before returning to school to finish a B.S. in physics.

Research Experience: About a year writing software to test electronics as part of the CMS upgrade.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Outstanding future teacher award; several scholarships

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: TA in Chemistry and Physics departments, lab coordinator, high school physics teacher

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: I did a lot in school my first time through (student government, coached, taught classes). I was also very involved in my community as a teacher after I graduated the first time.

Special Bonus Points: As a more "mature" student, I am sure I appear to be lower risk for failing.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I am a first generation college student from a relatively poor family.

Applying to Where:
All of these schools I expressed interest in doing neutrino experiments with the exception of Michigan State (nuclear).

Kansas State - Physics - Accepted
Michigan State - Physics - Accepted
Minnesota - Physics - Accepted
Duke - Physics - Accepted - Will Attend

CalTech - Physics - Rejected
Chicago - Physics - Rejected
Yale - Physics - Rejected
Berkeley - Physics - Rejected
Wisconsin - Physics - Rejected

Takeaway for future applicants
Prepare! I can some up all of my advice with that one word. Though, I will give some specific advice here, if you just stay on top of everything the process is much easier to deal with (and less stressful).
Research - We all know you should do a lot. I think it is also important to make sure that you are learning valuable skills from that research. Work in labs where they are doing the kind of work that you don't know how to do so that you learn new skills.
PGRE - Those who say it isn't that important are wrong. Of course we've all read about that person with a terrible score that got into some terrific place. But those are exceptions. I applied to much better schools than I was planning on applying to after I got a better score than I had planned on getting. Look at my GPA and research experience - without my PGRE score I would have probably been staying at my undergrad institution for grad school.
Make flashcards of equations that you don't know. I made about 120 of them and reviewed them every once in a while when I was waiting in line or eating lunch. I answered 4-5 questions on the exam correctly because I looked at the exact equation I needed right before the exam.
SOP - Start early. I wrote my first draft about 6 months before applications were due. I had anyone who would read it do so. I got some good advice and some less than helpful advice. But it is very easy to forward your most recent draft of your SOP to a professor. Consider having a prof outside of physics read it. I had a political science prof who proofreads texts on the side read mine. She made a lot of nice suggestions on sentence structure and word choice.

If anyone reading this has a sort of non-traditional route to grad school, feel free to PM me. I think I learned a lot about this process in going through it and would be more than happy to share with you what I feel are the challenges and the advantages (and I think there are many of these too) in being non-traditional.

I'm a bit late to the party, but hopefully next year's applicants can still benefit from my experiences :-P

Undergrad Institution: Top in Canada for physics
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): Mathematics
GPA in Major: 4.00/4.00
Overall GPA: 4.00/4.00
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: Top, or close to it
Type of Student: White Canadian male

GRE Scores:
Q: 170 (98%)
V: 169 (99%)
W: 5.5 (97%)
P: 970 (92%)

Research Experience: One summer + term project in experimental condensed matter, one summer in experimental AMO, one in theoretical AMO, and term project in experimental quantum optics, all at my home university. One publication (PRB) from the first of these.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Litany of "top in x" scholarships from home university, NSERC USRA (Canadian equivalent of REU) at home university in the summers of second year, NSERC USRA + Chair's Scholar (additional departmental award) in the summer of third year. No external awards.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Have held a nicely-titled peer mentoring position for the past two years.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Nothing..

Special Bonus Points: My recommenders seem to have extremely high opinions of me - two told me they'd directly contacted people at places I've applied... I worry this is entirely undeserved

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Made some gambles in my personal statements (particularly for Caltech and Princeton) that apparently did not pay off.. ;A;
My interests are a bit restrictive or limited / limiting: almost every university I applied to only has one person whose work interests me; I named the one person I was interested in for most of my apps.

Applying to Where:

Boulder - Quantum Optics - Accepted Jan. 31 via email with $8000 signing bonus
Berkeley - Quantum Optics / Ultracold Atoms - Accepted Feb. 4 via email to check website, offered Berkeley fellowship Feb. 28
Caltech - Quantum Optics - Rejected Mar. 10 with an amazingly impersonal email
Chicago - Quantum Optics / Condensed Matter (IME) - Accepted Jan. 15 via email + IME Graduate Fellowship - declined
Harvard - Quantum Optics - Accepted Feb. 13 via email, beautiful folder in the mail later - WILL ATTEND!
McGill - Quantum Optics - Unofficial acceptance via email Jan. 18 - declined, but really like two profs and am working there over the summer
MIT - Quantum Optics - Rejected Feb. 18 via email
Princeton - Quantum Optics / Condensed Matter - Rejected Feb. 14 via email
Stanford - Quantum Optics / Ultracold Atoms - Accepted Feb. 24 via email - declined
Yale - Quantum Optics - Accepted Feb. 14 via email - declined

I guess I agree with a few posters before me in that you're best off applying in the field of your best-connected recommender. I suspect mentioning a specific prof for most places helped me overall, but the admissions process remains pretty opaque to me. Apart from that, I'm very happy with my results - best of luck to all !! :-D
