Undergrad Institution: big state, ranked in 2nd decade according to 2012 US News
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): N/A
GPA in Major: 3.64
Overall GPA: 3.38
Length of Degree: 4.5 (started behind on prereqs)
Position in Class: no idea
Type of Student: Domestic white male

GRE Scores: old system 800/800/6
Q: 740 (79%)
V: 670 (94%)
W: 5 (87%)
P: 820 (76%)


Research Experience:
Start-up company with CTO. Publication submitted, 2nd author of 2 in Journal of Thin Solid Films.
Other misc, transient stuff that never got off the ground.
REU, at Purdue. Nuclear and Particles.
Research Technician at my school. AMO. One semester.
REU at Oklahoma State. AMO. Worked on publication but wouldn't heed my advisor's suggestions. I was an idiot.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Sigma Pi Sigma. Departmental Scholarship. Finalist in Engineering business plan competition.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: SPS Secretary. Particle detector construction volunteer. Annual Physics outreach volunteer. TA, undergraduate probability. Math tutor ~2 yrs (excluding relatives). Physics tutor 0.5 yrs (ibid).

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Non-thesis Masters in very academic Engineering discipline?

Special Bonus Points: One recommender has a lecture series named after him (may not use him). One recommender is Dept Chair of my school. Took really difficult graduate Engineering courses.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I go through spurts of omnivorous textbook reading e.g. assembly language programming. I read a year 1 "extended" Physics text, and a modern Physics text, cover to cover to study for PGRE. Not sure how this would show up on app?

Applying to Where: All either Atom Optics or Condensed Matter, or some combination thereof

Chicago - rejected 2/18
Illinois (UIUC) -rejected 3/29
Wisconsin - rejected 2/2
Ohio State - wait-listed 2/20. application withdrawn 4/13
Purdue - Accepted 2/14 via email! $17.8k TA for the 9-month academic year. Summers pay less monthly :?
Johns Hopkins (JHU) - rejected 4/13
Michigan - rejected 2/23

Comments: Was seriously considering a last minute offer from Ohio State on the basis of NRC rankings. However, after thinking long and hard about NRC rankings, I find them to be pretty baseless. There's 20 variables measured, which I don't clearly see how they make one Physics program intrinsically better than another. What does it matter if one program has 0.3 more citations per faculty (or whatever) than another? And that's one of the variables that might actually matter! Yet such a small difference equates to rank separations by the 10's!

I'm not sure who is the jerk responsible for taking until the last minute, the department or the applicants. After I decided rankings are bogus I was going to consider Ohio State holistically: town, department culture, joining the mile-high club on my way to Columbus, etc. But they couldn't even get back to me by the "end of the day" Friday 4/13 (4:30 pm Eastern) which was their targeted response time. I considered asking Purdue for more time, so I could visit Ohio State and make a final decision. I thought that was dicey enough with a competing offer. Then when I didn't have an offer "in hand" by Friday the 13th's end, which would have been the basis of asking for more time, I withdrew. I withdrew with the mindset that it's their problem now.

Undergrad Institution: Huge Public School, Top 20 for Physics
Major(s): Physics
GPA in Major: 4.0
Overall GPA: 4.0
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: Top
Type of Student: Domestic white male

I took the revised GRE, so Quantitative/Verbal are on the 170 point scale
GRE Scores:
Q: 166 (94%)
V: 168 (98%)
W: 4.5 (72%)
P: 960 (92%)

Research Experience: Have been working on a general relativity theory project with a professor and a grad student for over a year, no publication. Also, a condensed matter theory project with funding which will result in a first-name publication. I will have a preprint on arXiv by mid-February, probably too late for most schools (UPDATE: the damn paper probably won't be out until the summer, oh well). I will present my research at the 2012 APS March Meeting, I found out in time to list this on about 5-6 of my applications.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: One major outside scholarship.
Won the presidential scholarship at my school both years I was eligible (only two students in the physics department get nominated). This scholarship is very selective due to the enormous amount of students at my school.
Standard generic "distinguished honors" each semester.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Worked as a teaching assistant my junior year for engineering physics I & II, I also helped out tutoring intro physics students.

Special Bonus Points: Currently taking graduate quantum field theory, getting very high grades. (Update, got an A in the course). Lots of physics and math electives including general relativity, computational course, real and complex analysis, abstract algebra and topology (would have gotten a math degree if the core for math wasn't different). One of my recommenders mentioned having a lot of good connections, and I think his letter was very strong.

Applying to Where:
Applying for physics, first choice CMT, second choice HET.

Undergrad Institution: Large public university--top 20 for physics
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s):
GPA in Major: 3.93/4.0
Overall GPA: 3.87/4.0
Length of Degree: 4 years (finished in 3 years)
Position in Class: top
Type of Student: domestic male

GRE Scores: Note: I took both tests twice Fall 2006 and 2011 but both scores are reported
Q: 800 (94%) and 166 (96%)
V: 510 (64%) and 162 (90%)
W: 5.5 (96%) and 5.0 (87%)
P: 640 (42%) and 790 (72%)


Research Experience: I spent one summer working in spintronics lab in Germany, two semesters in a non-linear dynamics, and one summer as a research intern at a large oilfield service company--no publications (Note that I graduated in three years so hopefully this makes not publishing okay)

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: I recieved an award restricted to less than 1% of all graduating seniors in the college of natural sciences, a small fellowship to fund my senior thesis, a research forum poster award and a hand full of physics department scholarships

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: I worked in industry for four years after graduating--I wasn't doing research, but I worked in a technical role for a large company that produces electronic measurement and automation equiptment. I think it is definitely relevant experience since I'm interested in experimental condensed matter research.

Undergrad Institution: Early Entrance @ University of Washington (top-5 in atmospheric science, where I'll be getting most of my LORs from)
Major(s): Astronomy, Physics, Math
Minor(s): Applied Math
GPA in Major: 3.77 Astronomy, 3.76 for all Physics courses beyond freshman year (but it drops to 3.0-3.5 range when I include my bloody freshman year)
Overall GPA: In 3.0-3.5 range (3.58 for last two years)
Position in Class: Unknown as school doesn't report. But definitely one of the top students in the Astronomy department (though only with respect to Astronomy/Physics courses).
Type of Student: Domestic Parrot

GRE Scores:
Q: 167 (95%) - 800 on old GRE.
V: 166 (97%) - 700 on old GRE.
W: 6.0 (99%)
Biology: 810 (89%), completely self-studied without taking any courses asides from a grad-lvl neurophysiology course
Cellular & Molecular Biology: 82%
Organismal Biology: 89%
Ecology/Evolution/Population Biology: 91%
P: 680 (50%) <- this kid got too addicted to Quora and ended up cramming (rather inefficiently) for the PGRE in a week (though much of it was that I sacrificed PGRE study time for the Biology GRE). It makes me look like a complete fool, given all my past posts on this forum. Nonetheless, it doesn't matter anymore as you can see below...

Research Experience:
- Several years

Awards/Honors/Recognitions:
- National AP Scholar (8 self-studied APs)

Pertinent Activities or Jobs:
- Attended a grad-student summer program (CASS 2011 - http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/UHNAI/CASS2011/ ) as an undergrad last summer
- Quora Reviewer (have really built up the science sections on Quora up over the last few months), and am a top answerer on Astronomy, Biology, Neuroscience, Planetary Science, Atmospheric Science, Animal Behavior, Scientific Research, and Academia

Special Bonus Points:
- Grad-lvl courses in Neurophysiology, Planetary Atmospheres, Objective Analysis (aka Digital Signal Processing), High-Performance Scientific Computing, Numerical Linear Algebra, Causal Modelling (in statistics), Chinese Geography, and Ice/Climate (atmospheric science) - all with 3.4 GPA or above

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:
- My overall GPA got nuked by my idiocy when I was 16, but I'm still glad I did early entrance.
- Intense interdisciplinarity may help with earth/atmospheric/planetary science programs (even though it may be seen in a negative way by other programs). It turned out to really help with both Chicago and Brown.
- Numerous other factors, but best not to elaborate here. But very possibly one of the most unusual (and high-risk) applicants that anyone has ever seen.

Applying to Where:
Mostly programs with active professors who do 3D modelling of exoplanetary atmospheres + Brown (which fits my INTP personality well). At this point, though, general 3D GCM modelling would work just as well..

Brown - Geological Sciences - have received a number of "I'm interested in your application" emails late January - Accepted (with special fellowship for top applicants; TA duties relieved for 1st year) via dinner with Brown professor 2/13. Official acceptance via website 2/22, and again (via department email) 2/24, and again (via postal mail).
Stipend: $21,500 school + $1,405 departmental + $7,935 summer = $30,840/year
Caltech - Environmental Science and Engineering (ESE) - Rejected via departmental inquiry 1/23. Official rejection via email 2/13
Chicago - Geophysical Sciences - Exoplanetary Atmospheres - Accepted with McCormick Fellowship via email 1/25. Official acceptance via postal mail postmarked 2/03.
Stipend: ($2250/month if RA or $2350/month if TA) for 12 months. So $27,000 + $4,500 fellowship = $31,500/ year if I RA for the first year.
Columbia - Astronomy - Not sure if they actually went all the way through in copying my application from EESC to Astro...
Columbia - Earth and Environmental Science (EESC) - Climate Science -
MIT - Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences (EAPS) - Planetary Science - Rejected via email 3/15
Yale - Geology & Geophysics - Atmospheres, Ocean, and Climate Dynamics (AOCD) - Shortlisted and invited for visit/interview 1/12 - Not admitted via website 2/15. I suppose that the interviews revealed that I wasn't enough of a research fit, though if I did more research before applying, then I might have actually emailed the person who was looking at expanding into exoplanetary atmospheres (who went on vacation during decisions week)... Anyways - it's an interesting story, since I was very possibly in competition for the same exact slot as someone I contacted at gradcafe (but there were no other slots I could be in). I'm still very glad that I applied and visited though (even though I was hesitant about the research fit from the very beginning), since I learned a lot and was able to visit Brown in the same trip.
UCSC - Astronomy - Rejected via email 2/10

Withdrawn applications:

Washington - Atmospheric Science
Cornell - Atmospheric Science
Penn State - Astronomy
UCLA - Geophysics & Space Physics

In any case, with the information I have now, I don't think that I would have gotten into any of those 4 schools.

Strongly considered, but cancelled before applying:

Berkeley EPS, Princeton AOS, Harvard EPS, Oregon State COAS, Arizona LPL, Hawaii

P: 2010: 720, 2011: 850




TOEFL Total: no need, since I have a degree from US institution (who cares :) ), taking it again would be waist of money, so I decided to apply to places where It is not required for me.


Research Experience: Published paper in physics letters during undergrad period as 2nd author, theoretical work. Actually, I think, it is quite impressive to be able to publish such a paper during undergrad period. Besides, that research required knowledge of very advanced theoretical courses like QFT, Advanced QM, Theoretical Optics..... It was very hard work, but good experience!

Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: top 25%
Type of Student: domestic white male *yawn*

GRE Scores (revised/old version): Old version
Q: 800 (94%)
V: 660 (94%)
W: 5.0 (87%)
P: 660 (46%)/940 (90%) [see below for explanation of ridiculous score discrepancy]

Research Experience: 1 summer working on big collider type exp. 1 summer working on precision measurement experiment. 1 summer+school year working on senior thesis project in atomic physics (BEC). Publication in Science from the last project. Poster session on my work for the collider exp, and talk given for work on the BEC project, both the poster and talk were given at some type of APS meeting.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Graduated summa cum laude?

Special Bonus Points: One of my recommenders has connections at a couple of schools where I'm applying

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: PGRE problem: I'm one of those kids who always answers all of the questions in the booklet first, goes over them, and then only transfers my answers from the book to the scantron when there's about 10 minutes left... which of course allows me to get screwed over by the clock being 10 minutes slow on my first PGRE attempt. Time ran out before I had transferred all of my answers to the scantron, so I had to take a `gap year' and redid the exam in April.

Applying to Where: All for AMO Experiment

MIT-Rejected
Stanford -Rejected
Maryland College Park
Colorado Boulder-Rejected
Rice- Accepted

U Pittsburgh - Accepted, 02/15 by email. ~$24k for 1st year--->WILL ATTEND

NOTE FOR FUTURE APPLICANTS :-
1. Astronomy Departments are generally very small (maybe except Harvard), and not nearly as well funded as Physics departments. As a result, they have very few slots for new students each year (Berkeley for example, had only 5-6 for 130+ applicants. Ohio had 5 for 140 applicants, Minnesota had 4 for 70 etc.). So if you're an astronomy applicant and your application is anything short of "excellent", I would recommend applying to Physics/Physics&Astronomy departments where you'll get a statistically better chance of admission and also find some astro professors working on decent astro projects. If you do feel compelled to apply to Astro departments (especially since they have a wider variety of astro research), apply to as many of them as possible, and say your prayers.

2. Experimental/observational research is much less competitive than theoretical research areas. From the conversations I've had with professors and grad students, if you want to do theoretical research, make sure you have a very strong academic side (GPA, GRE, Math/physics grades, advanced courses, minor etc.) Having hands-on/laboratory experience will probably help you more for experimental research. They also usually have more open positions and future job-prospects.

3. Call up professors and grad students of your desired universities, at least a few months before you start applying. Learn more about their research, whether they are accepting grad students, whether they are retiring, the future of that research area and possible PhD research topics in that field. Tell them about your own research. Make them get to know you better. Ask grad students about how their professors are, how life is at the university and their opinion of the quality of research. You'll get valuable inside information that'll help you better judge your "favorite" universities. And building connections with professors will be priceless, especially since they can ultimately recommend your admission. I started doing this, but gave up when some of them didn't reply. Don't make this mistake! Most of them won't reply, or simply brush you away, but be persistent. All you need is 1-2 professors to actually like you, and that could mean jackpot!

4. DO NOT ignore Safety Schools. You may not be as good as you think, and there are chances you might overestimate the strength of your application. I definitely got scratched by all my top and within reach choices. Ultimately, my safeties ensured I got a chance for a PhD this year.

5. Try staying away from Physicsgre, Gradcafe etc. during the waiting period, especially if you're not getting acceptances or not hearing back from schools. It just heightens your anxiety. I nearly had a nervous breakdown in the middle of February when I had 0 acceptances, and I kept seeing people here getting accepted/waitlisted to places I was eagerly waiting to hear back from. I used to visit this place atleast 10-20 times a day, and I vowed not to log in till atleast April. Since then, life became much more peaceful. I focused on studying and research. Got good grades. Partied hard. Dated some hot chicks. Started a blog. Did some public nights. And finally got accepted to grad schools :D

Good luck kids!

Two semesters researching Computational Astrophysics at my undergraduate institution. The group does numerical simulations on astrophysical phenomena ranging from supernova remnants, turbulence, stellar winds, and active galactic nuclei jets. I have researched parallelizable relaxation methods to speed up the convergence of the simulations in their slowest areas, particularly in solving elliptical PDEs such as the diffusion equation. My research will be written up in my senior thesis this spring.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions:

I received an academic merit based scholarship from the astronomy department last spring, granted to only two students within the department per year.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs:

Active member of the Society of Physics Students at my university.
Paid research assistant the summer after my junior year, working in the area mentioned above.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

Special Bonus Points:
My research advisor is fairly well known within the computational astrophysics community, which will help me in the numerical relativity applications.

P: 630 (39%)

Research Experience: One summer at home institution in QM theory, most closely related to CM. Resulted in publication (2nd author of 3 in EPJ B).

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Dean's list while abroad.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: SPS President, grader for intro classes.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Helped get SPS rechartered on campus?

Special Bonus Points: Not a hipster?

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Decided on physics late (end of 2nd year) and then went abroad (junior fall) for a semester, so I've had to do half of the major in the past two semesters.

Applying to Where: Undecided on a particular focus, but all applications are for pure physics, whatever department that falls under.

UNC Chapel Hill - Waitlisted 3/7, class filled up literally the morning I went to visit :cry:
Duke - Rejected 2/21
NC State - Accepted 4/10 to MS program
Rice - Rejected 3/29
Vanderbilt - Rejected 4/3
Virginia - Rejected 4/4
Virginia Tech - Accepted 2/11

U Washington - Rejected 3/23
Wash U - never heard a word. Never cared enough to bug them more.
William & Mary - Waitlisted 3/15, Accepted 4/4

*From my correspondences, it seems that schools (at least those that I've heard from) were very careful about predicting their yield sizes, admitting smaller sets of students and waiting for those offers to be signed or applications withdrawn before extending more offers than they can fund. Multiple schools told me that in previous years, I would have received an offer of admission with the first batch of acceptances.

GRE Scores (took old test so old scores):
Q: 800
V: 410 :oops:
W: 4.0 (ehh)
P: 810 (74%)

Research Experience: 9 month project developing an atmospheric CO2 model with a prof. Publication is resulting, under review with AJP and they told us it will be published as soon as we make some minor revisions.

An REU project that has become my honors thesis. This is an AMO theoretical, and experimental project designing a new microscopy instrument.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: SPS VP, VP for another student organization.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: I was heavily involved in the 4H club growing up and received a lot of awards and distinctions in the program over my 11 year membership

Special Bonus Points: Im a farmboy, our family was poor because we spent 30 years paying off the mortgages. It was a very Isolated childhood and I try to make it clear on applications that I was able to let my imagination run wild and thus, become a physicist at heart.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Decided on physics late (end of 2nd year) and then went abroad (junior fall) for a semester, so I've had to do half of the major in the past two semesters.

Since I have done extensive research/work with two profs, I should get good letters from them. One is well known in his field but the work we did was unrelated to his main interest. I have a fourth reference that I use on a couple applications who is out of the department.

Major(s): Physics, Computer Science, Spanish
Minor(s):
GPA in Major: 3.66
Overall GPA: 3.66

Type of Student: Domestic White Male

GRE Scores (old version):
Q: 800
V: 600
W: 4.5
P: 720

Research Experience: Worked for two summers and two school years doing research for the same professor at my University. He is pretty well known in his field, though. No publications but conference proceedings from an international conference (not first author on those, either, though).

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Quite a few top 3 finishes in programming competitions, won a fellowship for my research.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Computer programming competition team.

Special Bonus Points: A few of my recommenders went to UMN and UW-Madison. One of my professors called my school a "pipeline to Madison" and was very confident I would get in, since my numbers are above average for my school. I think he's overconfident, though.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Probably a negative, if anything, but I am pretty well rounded. I worked as a resident assistant, studied in South America, and took a ton of classes outside of my major, which is partly why I only have ~2 years of research. On the positive side, I think that the fact that I followed my instincts and did what I was interested in probably raised the quality of my recommendations pretty significantly... I've also published a few iOS Apps that have gotten a few hundred thousand downloads (but still, sadly, not a million... :cry: )

Applying to Where:

University of Minnesota - Physics - Condensed Matter - Accepted 1/27/12!
University of Wisconsin-Madison - Physics - Condensed Matter
Northwestern - Physics - Condensed Matter

Research Experience: REU for a summer at home institution in experimental condensed matter; continued work my last semester senior year, though project didn't amount to anything. I graduated in May '11, and since September, I've been working on two research projects: one in experimental condensed matter at my home institution, and one in computational MRI (designing and simulating of RF pulses used in MRI; it will likely lead to a publication in the Journal of Magnetic Resonance).

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Outstanding Teaching Assistant award, junior year

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: TA'd intro classical mechanics, E&M, and quantum mechanics courses for 4 semesters; LA for classical mechanics course for 1 semester

Special Bonus Points: white domestic male :P

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: My GPA was adversely affected by fall sophomore year—where I had an episode of depression—and fall senior year—where I took more courses than I could handle in an attempt to double major in mathematics. Also, my recommendations (two from current research, one from professor I TA'd for) should be pretty good


Applying to Where:

Rejected:
CU Boulder - CME, AMO, Physics education Rejected 3/12/12 via email
UC Berkeley - CME, Biophysics, AMO Rejected 3/13/12 via email
UCI - CME Rejected 4/10/12 via email

UC Davis - CME Rejected 3/4/12 via application system
SUNY Stony Brook - CME Rejected 3/20/12 via email
UMD College Park - Quantum information, CME Rejected 4/6/12 via application system

Accepted:
UCSD - CME, Computational neurobiology Unofficial acceptance 1/31/12 via phone and email. Official acceptance 2/23/12 via email. $17.3K TA. -Declined offer.
U British Columbia -CME, AMO Unofficial acceptance 2/20/12 via email. Official acceptance 3/5/12 via email. Minimum of 18K RA+TA for each year of MSc, 21K RA+TA for each year of PhD.-Declined offer.
U Toronto - CME, Quantum optics Waitlisted 3/13/12 via phone call. Official acceptance 4/16/12 via phone and email. Minimum of 19.5K RA+TA for each year.-Accepted offer.

This was an extremely difficult choice to make. I'm sure I would have been happy at any of the places I got accepted. I first limited my choice to UBC and U of T, but overall, Toronto came out on top (one particular professor doing interesting work who really wanted to work with me + 2 other professors I could see myself working with, unique structure of MSc program, cool city and campus, etc.)

Minor(s): Math
GPA in Major: 3.52 (when I applied), 3.50
Overall GPA: 3.483 (when I applied), 3.479
Length of Degree: 4 years.

Type of Student: Domestic Chinese-American male

GRE Scores (revised/old version): Revised
Q:170 - 99%
V:162 - 90%
W:4.5 - 75%
P:890 - 85%

Research Experience: Two, one in plasma physics and one in solid state. First experience was bad, 2 quarters, didn't accomplish much more than an analysis program. Second experience is 4 quarters + ongoing, working on spintronics, supposedly we're going to publish a paper in the near future but the postdoc is pretty not on top of his ***, attended the WIN conference at CNSI with him, etc. Both experiences at UCLA (:/ I only applied for a summer REU once but one of my favorite professors told me that they don't like students who are already at research universities as much so I gave up after that first rejection.. stupid me).

Awards/Honors/Recognitions:

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Not really. I'm webmaster for an irrelevant club and technically a member of SPS.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

Special Bonus Points: I think one of my recommenders is pretty famous, or at least, he has a shitload of publications. The other one is the postdoc, which isn't spectacular. The last is a string theorist, which doesn't help as much since I'm looking for experimental physics.. Hmm... My parents are immigrants, and I'm the first to go for a Ph.D./first to go into a scientific field.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:

Applying to Where: 13 programs, 12 schools, for all of them, I've indicated my preference as either Plasma Physics, Nuclear Fusion Science, etc. Basically anything having to do with fusion. Although I think it's listed as nonlinear dynamics in one of them .. Oops, forgot to add, EXPERIMENTAL for all of them as well.

Undergrad Institution: St. Olaf College (midwestern liberal arts college)
Majors: Physics, Mathematics
Concentration: Statistics
GPA in Major: 3.92 (physics)
Overall GPA: 3.83
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: Top or near top of 25-30 students
Type of Student: domestic white male

GRE Scores (revised version):
Q: 166 (94%)
V: 167 (98%)
W: 5.5 (96%)
P: 840 (79%)


Research Experience: Two summer REUs. One at my school doing AMO data analysis, one at General Atomics doing programming for their fusion program. Also one research experience in statistical finance for a large Midwestern electronics retailer. (Had to sign an NDA, but I bet you can guess which company it was...Hint: I'm from Minnesota.)

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Member of Sigma Pi Sigma, graduating magna cum laude, will probably graduate with distinction in physics.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: SPS president senior year, physics clinician for 2.5 years (essentially homework help for all of the pre-med students who need to take a year of intro physics for the MCAT)

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Presented a poster on research at General Atomics this fall at the APS Division of Plasma Physics annual meeting in Salt Lake City.

Special Bonus Points: One of my recommenders went to UCSD and still works near there (GA is literally across the street), so that might help for that application. Also, my school is known for its math program, which focuses on pure mathematics. One of my recommenders is a math professor, and the associate dean of the science program there.

Applying to Where:

In my statements of purpose, I have listed HEP theory as my preferred specialization, but I know that HEP theory is one of the most, if not the most, competitive areas of physics, and so I made sure to emphasize that I would really like to explore different areas. You can see from some of the stuff I wrote above that I have had a wide range of research experiences already.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: For places that ask about it, I mention that my entire education has been funded by working summers and scholarships and that I'm the first member of my family to pursue graduate education.

Applying to Where:
Research interest: Planetary science project involving both theory (dynamics) and observational components. Especially interested in solar system objects and exoplanets.

Will be attending:
Caltech - Geological and Planetary Sciences -- Accepted Jan 20! $29K fellowship; visited March 1-2

Offers Declined:
University of Arizona - Planetary science (LPL) -- Accepted Feb 1! Autumn-Spring TA/RA: $16K, 20hrs/week (+$11K for summer possibly); visited Feb 27-28
Cornell - Astronomy -- Accepted Feb 14! Cornell Graduate Fellowship $26.4K (+$9.7K for summer research); visited March 9-10
University of Toronto - Astronomy -- Accepted Feb 14! Minimum Grad funding is $20k + tuition + top up of 50% of any external scholarship (up to $3000 cap); visit date March 12-13 (did not visit)
U Washington - Astronomy -- Interview Feb 15, Accepted by email+phone Feb 24! 20hr/week TA/RA 13,720 + summer RA/RA 3,050 + 1.5K fellowship = 18,270 + tuition + health insurance; visit date March 29-30 (did not visit).

Rejections:
UC Santa Cruz - Astronomy -- Rejected by email Feb 10
UC Berkeley - Astronomy -- Rejected by email Feb 14, "We had over 130 applicants for roughly six new student slots"
Harvard - Astronomy -- Rejected by postal mail received Feb 21. Letter was dated Feb 13

Some notes, maybe for future applicants reading this thread: I felt very lucky to have to make a decision between many great planetary science programs. My PGRE score was pretty low and being an international applicant, I felt that applying to a large number of schools was the safest way. But, I mostly aimed for top schools/places I'd want to live since I don't want to go through the trouble of moving to another country if I was not going to be happy with the school/city. In the end, my wife and I made the choice by weighing both the city and the school equally.

Good luck to everyone else applying this year!

Undergrad Institution: Probably one of the best for Physics in Australia (which isn't saying much). Not particularly strong in my areas of interest.
Major(s): Physics (Honours), Mathematics (no Honours)
Minor(s):
GPA in Major: N/A (see below)
Overall GPA: N/A (see below)
Length of Degree: 4
Position in Class: First out of ~25 (for Physics Honours)
Type of Student: International white male

My university doesn't give a GPA. I got First Class Honours with University Medal, which counts for a lot in Australia, but who knows if US admissions committees even know what that means...

GRE Scores (revised version):
Q: 167 (95%)
V: 168 (98%)
W: 4.5 (72%)
P: 990 (95%)

Research Experience: Some first author publications in Physical Review, outside the fields I'm applying for. A major project (worth half of the marks in my fourth year) in quantum information theory with connections to condensed matter theory -- should definitely lead to publications, but they're still being written.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions:
Best physics Honours project (within my university).

Pertinent Activities or Jobs:

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

Special Bonus Points:
Strong recommendations, I think.
Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:

Applying to Where:

UC Santa Barbara - Physics - CMT - accepted 2/24 by email
Stanford - Physics - CMT - rejected 2/29 be email
Caltech - Physics - Quantum information theory/CMT accepted 2/16 by email
Illinois - Physics - CMT - accepted 2/9 by email
Yale - Physics - CMT - accepted 2/17, email to check website

Now I wish I'd applied to some more top places, say Berkeley or MIT... oh well.

Applying

University of California-Irvine (received email requesting official transcripts 01/19 and saying admissions decision should be made in a week..... or not (2/9) )Accepted and offered visit via email 3/9, no word on funding yet
" Riverside Accepted with generous funding 2/15 by email

University of Florida-HET or GravitationAccepted TA/RA 3/23
New York University-Theory rejected 3/8 via email
Notre Dame-Theory withdrawn
University of Amsterdam, Institute for Theoretical Physics-HET-Rejected
Montana State- Gravity Theory withdrawn

Notes: theoretical high energy physics is a competitive field. I suspect a big part of this is the fact that funding is in short supply compared to other disciplines in physics such as condensed matter theory. I knew this when I applied, and that is why I applied to so many places. The few offers of acceptance are enough for me, as I don't care about going to an ivy league school. It has been my dream for some time to study advanced high energy theory. To future applicants, make sure you actually want to study in this field, as if you choose another, even high energy experiment, you probably can have more options.

Minor(s): Latin
GPA in Major: 4.00+/4.00
Overall GPA: 4.00+/4.00
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: Top
Type of Student: White, domestic, male

GRE Scores (revised/old version): Old (took it the last day it was available)
Q: 800 (94%)
V: 710 (98%)
W: 4.5 (72%)
P: 860 (82%)

Research Experience: 2 years at the time of application with the same professor at my school. I had one published paper (2nd author out of 3) and am working on a new project. I never did an REU or worked with another professor.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: All from my school except for the Robert C. Byrd scholarship: President's/Dean's List, generic good grades scholarships, nothing from astronomy/physics department.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Just the research.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Went to the 2012 AAS meeting and presented my poster.

Special Bonus Points: Took one graduate level astronomy course before my application and taking another this spring semester. I'm told my research supervisor is well-known (only in his field?) by others, but he's not famous-famous. I'm not sure how strong his letter was. (He's so aloof and intelligent that it's hard to gauge his expectations and opinions.) He had his PhD from Princeton. I had another recommender who received her PhD from UCLA, two schools to which I applied.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Went to the 2012 AAS meeting in August.

Applying to Where: All Astronomy/Astrophysics graduate schools. I expressed my top interests to all of them as being cosmology, planetary formation, and galaxy formation and evolution.

Schools: Berkeley (2/15: Rejected via email)
Schools: Caltech (2/22: Rejected via email)
Schools: Santa Cruz (2/2: Shortlisted by email, invited for Skype interview) (2/10: Rejected via email)
Schools: UCLA (2/7: Offered admission by email, waiting for details) (4/02: Declined offer.)

Schools: Texas (2/1: Offered admission by email, tuition + $27,000) (2/10: Declined offer.)
Schools: Chicago (2/6: Waitlisted.)
Schools: Michigan (1/31: Offered admission by email, no details yet) (2/10: Declined offer.)
Schools: Penn State (1/28: Offered admission by phone with a minimum offer of $24,000 plus tuition + $6,000 fellowship for the first year (2/29)) (4/02: Declined offer.)
Schools: UPenn (3/26: Rejected via email)
Schools: Harvard (2/13: Rejected via email inquiry)
Schools: Princeton (2/1: Rejected via email)
Schools: Yale (1/31: Offered admission by phone, $30,450 + tuition) (4/06: Will be going)

Note: Visited Arizona, UCLA, Yale, and Penn State, and I had great times at all four. Really tough decision.

Undergrad Institution: St. John's College, Santa Fe. Very small idiosyncratic liberal arts school, zero physics rep.
Major(s): Liberal Arts (Double major in Philosophy/History of Mathematics and Science)
Minor(s): (Double minor in Classics and Comparative Lit)
GPA in Major: 4.0 in Math/Science
Overall GPA: 3.98
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: NA (no class ranks at St. John's)
Type of Student: Domestic whit male
GRE Scores (revised/old version):
Q: 161 (86%)
V: 160 (86%)
W: 4.5
P: 750 (64%)

Research Experience: Approximately five months with the VERITAS experiment, with scientists at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago. Not much material to show for it apart from a recommendation.

Undergrad Institution: Major Canadian research university.
Major(s): Physics & Mathematics
Minor(s): None
GPA in Major: 3.96
Overall GPA: 3.96
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: We don't do rankings, and I can only speculate... So I won't comment.
Type of Student: Canadian male

GRE Scores: Revised Exam
Q: 165 - 96%
V: 166 - 97%
W: 5.5 - 96%
P: 770 - 68% : (
I should have studied more for the P-GRE. It was right during midterm season, and right after the application for the NSERC PostGraduate Scholarship was due. I was working in the summer, too, and so I didn't prepare very well. It's not an excuse, of course, but if you're applying next year, learn from my mistake and start preparing as early as possible, as much as possible. It turns out, the P-GRE is nontrivial, and thinking otherwise was a major mistake in judgement.

Research Experience: Worked in research for 4 summers in biophysics and CMP-E;
2 first-author publications (a real paper and a conference proceeding),
one 4th author paper,
one 3rd author in review at the time of applications.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: I won some departmental/faculty and university scholarships - enough to cover tuition. Held the NSERC USRA (equivalent to the NSF REU) twice.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Involved in student government in physics department.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: None that I'm aware of...

Special Bonus Points: I worked fairly closely with all my referees, two of them being research supervisors, and I published in both labs.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I'm fairly good with computers & programming. Not as good as a computer scientist, of course, but I've noticed that other people in the lab tend to ask me when they are stuck with computer issues. I'm also fairly good at setting up new pieces of equipment, and I'm pretty good at LabVIEW. Should come in handy in experimental physics.

Applying to Where: All applications are to Physics Department for Condensed Matter Physics - Experimental.

Columbia University - Admitted, Feb. 3; Dean's Fellow - 32k/year fellowship for 5 years; + $5k account for supplies and conferences over 2 years <<< Will Attend
Princeton University - Rejected, Feb. 20.
Cornell University - Admitted, Feb. 9; TAship - $25k for 9 months (~20 hrs/week), then possible summer funding, for $5 - 9k. Declined
MIT - Rejected, Feb. 29.
Stanford University - Rejected, Feb. 29.
CalTech - Rejected, Feb. 23.
University of Toronto (Masters) - Admitted (to PhD), Feb. 24 by mail; Entrance scholarship + ~5 hrs/week TAship; $24k/year (CDN) after tuition. Declined
Cambridge University (Direct-Entry PhD.) - Admitted, Feb. 15; 11kPounds per year in funding, for 3 years (~4 year program) Declined

External Awards:
NSERC PostGraduate Scholarships (Masters) - Value: ~17k Cdn. for 1 year - Approved (for CGS), April 10, 2012

Very happy at this point - Columbia was a top choice (and so was Cornell), although I'm slightly disappointed I've been rejected from some of the other ones, especially Princeton. But that just makes the choice easier. : )

Note to future generations: don't screw up on that Physics GRE! Now I'll go ahead and make Princeton regret their decision.

Overall GPA: 3.01 (3.7 jr/sr)
Length of Degree: 5 years
Position in Class: N/A
Type of Student: Domestic white male

GRE Scores (revised/old version):
Q:91%
V:79%
W:29%
P:66%

Research Experience: Two years of work. One in particle astro and the other in multimessenger astronomy. The particle work was pretty standard stuff, don't think it sets me apart; however, the MMA work was pretty serious. It is a new project and I was the only student on it for a good while. It's picked up some steam now, but I assume it looks pretty good that I managed to get it off the ground for about a year by myself. No publications. I gave a talk, but never thought to mention it unless my recommender did.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: None (unless you count Dean's list... which you shouldn't)

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Mainly what I put under research experience. I also worked as a freelance web developer in high school; it was listed on my resume, but never mentioned it.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I wasn't planning on posting my profile here, but I haven't seen anyone else quite in my situation. I had about a 2.0 GPA at the end of my sophomore year, but turned it around and have had almost all As (two A-) in upper level physics. I had a lot of trouble figuring out what schools to apply to because some schools will see me as a "good turn around story," while others will see me as a risk. So I hope this helps some people who are in my position. The only other thing worth mentioning is that I believe I had pretty strong recommendations. Two of them were from research advisors who I believe think very highly of me, and the other was from a former professor that I kept a strong relationship with and have worked for in my time doing multimessenger stuff.

Applying to Where:

These were all for a mix of High Energy Theory/Experiment, Phenomenology, and Cosmology Theory/Experiment depending on how many faculty worked in each field.

Will fill in as I have time/feel like it/more responses come in:

Undergrad Institution: Big state. Top 20 USNews grad program
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): Math
GPA in Major: 3.5 (don't remember to hundreths/thousandths)
Overall GPA: 3.167
Length of Degree: 5 total, 3 in physics :?
Position in Class: Near top in core phys, btw near top & avg in elective phys, avg in math & overall
Type of Student: Domestic white male

GRE Scores (revised/old version):
Q: 161 (86%)
V: 161 (89%)
W: 3.5 (29%)
P: 750 (64%) <-- A relief, but still not quite there for my profile

Research Experience:
Worked with one plasma group ~1.5 years. Senior thesis being written with same group. Thesis focus is on designing spectrometer for a plasma diagnostic (CHERS in case anyone's interested). Haven't accomplished much with the group besides thesis.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: None?

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: None?

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:
Chosen to co-author paper with my QM prof on a numerical technique for general 1-D eigensystems. Will submit to AJP.

Special Bonus Points:
* Ok grades in core physics:
Classical & Quant. Mech: 4.0 [Fall '11, Fall '12]
E&M [Spring '11], Optics [Spring '11], and intro classes [Fall' 11 and earlier]: 3.5
Stat. Mech. & Electronics: 3.0 [both Fall '12] :cry:
Intermed. Lab: 4.0 [Fall '11]

* LOR from plasma PI, the QM prof, and my optics prof. Will be positive, but better than average? Unsure.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:
* Pretty much straight B's in math. Our school doesn't inflate math grades much so that's just above "average," tho that isn't an excuse or anything. Also transferred from Biology/Psychology major my junior year. This was a difficult transition, as I had to take some difficult semesters and remember how to do math... and actually employ basic logic and problem solving skills :wink:
* Now that I think of it, I have a few "drops" on my transcript. Most are of no consequence, but I do have about 4, one of them an intermediate physics lab. Realized I overloaded myself w/ coursework after the deadline. Does anyone know the effect this could have?

Applying to Where:

University of California - Davis - Physics - CM(E) - rejected 2/16 by website after receiving email a few days before (stating that a decision would soon be made).
University of Michigan - Ann Arbor - Applied Physics - CM(E)/Optics(E) - rejected 2/20 by email not but two hours after writing this: Seem to have their normal pool of admits, but not sure if they have a waitlist. Shoot me a PM if you know something!
University of Washington - Seattle - Physics - CM(E)/AMO(E) - rejected 3/22 via email
University of Colorado - Boulder - Physics - AMO/Plasma - rejected 3/2 via email
Michigan State University - Physics - CM(E)/Nuclear(E) - rejected 2/29 via email.
Ohio State University - Physics - CM(E)/AMO(E) - rejected 2/21 via website after inquiring about status., rejected a few days after by post, and rejected 3/22 by email The email stressed international student applicants. Wondering if I got the wrong email? Anyway, 3 rejects from one institution! Don't I feel special :wink:
University of California - Irvine - Physics - CM(E)/Plasma(E) - rejected 4/10 via email... FINALLY Good thing I wasn't waiting around for this reply! How shameful. Especially when they knew plasma experiment didn't want anyone...
University of Oregon - Eugene - Physics - Optics(E)/AMO(E) - rejected 3/13 by email Though I would not be able to attend for personal reasons, this one hurts
Wendy's - Custodial Sciences - Mop techniques/Stain removal theory - application withdrawn
*EDIT:*
Ok, so maybe it didn't quite work out this year... Let this serve as a sobering reminder that things can go completely and utterly wrong.
*EDIT#2:*
I will be moving to Ann Arbor this summer/fall and will probably try to apply to a number of their programs either next year or in two. In the meantime, I will be volunteering/working somewhere to pad my resume and get more experience.

Some advice to future generations:
*Don't spend your time agonizing over this site once apps are in. Check it every now and again, but don't let it take over your life. Head outside or go get some ice cream or something. Checking this site won't get you responses any quicker and will drive you crazy!
*For any younger readers (maybe freshman/sophomores) GET GOOD GRADES! We all know grades aren't necessarily indicative of ability or level of intelligence and blah blah blah, but for pete's sake just get the grade! I know sometimes the classes are astonishingly boring and almost vacuous in content, but schools need objective evidence of your scholarship. Betting on outstanding research is risky and IMO the PGRE is a secondary to the previous two. Do not depend on the PGRE to save your app! In summation, DON'T GIVE THE ADMISSIONS COMMITTEE AN INCH TO DOUBT WHEN IT COMES TO YOUR STATS!
*Get involved in a group, and do it early. I managed to do this, though my situation is a little weird and ended up doing paperwork for the first half year or so. Don't think that you're too inexperienced; they need people to do mechanical things like soldering... so do it and do it well! This will most likely be your best recommender, someone that can help the committee distinguish you from the pack.
* 3 years is not enough! At least, an imperfect but decent 3 years wasn't enough... For anyone else in a similar situation, I recommend sucking it up and going for 4. Even if grades, research, and PGRE are pretty damn good I think the extra year will probably bump you up into an even higher tier of schools.
* Good luck!

Undergrad Institution: Top 20 university in the south, not known for physics.
Major(s): Physics, Mathematics
Minor(s):
GPA in Major: 3.95
Overall GPA: 3.77
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: Ill defined, but near top
Type of Student: Domestic, South-Asian heritage

GRE Scores (revised version):
Q: 165 (95%)
V: 162 (93%)
W: 4.5 (72%)
P: 820 (76%) :!: Did not study enough.

Research Experience: Three years research experience at my school. First year was in an experiment biophysics lab, which also turned into a summer REU. This was with a new professor, not well known or established, with a small lab. Next two years were in computational biophysics with a person known well in his field. The topic is really a mix between stochastic processes and information processing. No paper yet- hopefully we will have one by the end of the semester. However, this information will not show up on my apps. I also did a summer REU at Ga Tech in EE on organic electronics.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Merit based scholarship given to incoming students, sophomore physics and mathematics awards, one research distinction.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Tutor for physics and mathematics, TA for intro physics course.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: I'm in three graduate physics courses right now, but this might not mean much as the university's physics department is not well known.

Special Bonus Points: I had at least two very good recommendation letters, as well as another which might have been really good (I didn't get a good read on the professor). For schools that allowed it, I had a fourth recommendation letter from my PI at Tech, which was probably just so-so as I never worked alongside with him. Also, the two biophysics projects that I have worked on have been completely independent, with just me on the project. I probably had a good personal statement too.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:

Applying to Where:

Non-physics, biophysics programs:

Harvard - Systems Biology: Interviewed 2/3 , Accepted by email 2/28 , Offer accepted 4/16
Cornell - Computational Biology and Medicine: Interviewed 3/4 , Accepted by email 3/21
Caltech - Computational Neuroscience: Never heard back (had my application forwarded to them, but I'm not sure if they ever got it)
U Washington (Seattle) - Physiology and Biophysics: Interviewed 2/17 , Unofficially accepted by email 2/24
UCSB - Biomolecular science and engineering: Rejected by website 3/20.

Physics programs, concentration biophysics:

Caltech - Applied Physics: Rejected by email 4/4
Stanford - Applied Physics: Rejected by snail mail 3/7. This was one of my top two :(.
UCSD - Physics: Unofficially accepted by email 2/9
U Penn - Physics: Rejected by website 4/1
U Wisconsin - Madison - Physics: Rejected by email 2/2 (Applied to CME, not biophysics here. Thought I'd take a shot in CM like everyone else :D)
U Minnesota - Physics: Accepted by email 1/25
Ga Tech - Physics: Accepted by email 3/9

Other:

Harvard - SEAS - Applied Math: Rejected by snail email 4/6
Ga Tech - EE - Bioengineering: Accepted by snail mail 2/10



Notes: I really wish I had applied to more physics graduate programs. My PI warned me that with my PGRE score I might not be able to get into "top" programs, which really discouraged me. However, after browsing through the results on this site, I really think I stood a good chance at U Chicago, UIUC, etc. (between top 10 and top 20), especially since my PI knew people there. Goes to show- try anyways, even if you don't think you'll get in. Also, during the application process I didn't think I was going to get into anywhere (thus the wide distribution of application) and completely misjudged myself. I think the key thing here is that I applied to programs that I could make a case for in my personal statement. *U Wisconsin, for which I had absolutely no background except a whim, is a perfect example of NOT doing this. But to any applicants that read this in the future, try where ever you can and don't be discouraged! :D

Q: 800
V: 690
W: 5.5
P: 810 (Oct 2010), 880 (Nov 2010), 940 (Nov 2011)


Research Experience: Did spintronics research for the past two years in my home country's research institute, developed some interesting theoretical results resulting in some patents.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Departmental award in physics

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Taught high school physics, TA a class in heat & mass transfer

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Nyet

Special Bonus Points: Obtained a degree in ChemE as well

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: This is actually my second year applying to grad schools, and from the first cycle I was quite sure that my letters were not strong enough, and I made effort to get much stronger letters from my home institute, even though they have been in industry for quite some time and are not as well-known in academic circles. I also made sure that I improved my PGRE to a decent score.

Applying to Where:

MIT - Physics - CME/CMT Accepted 17 Feb - Will attend!
Berkeley - Physics - CME/CMT Accepted 25 Feb, 22.5K/10 mths TAship + 6K summer RA
Cornell - Physics - CME Accepted 15 Feb, 25K/9 mths TAship + 8K summer RA
Harvard - Physics - CME/CMT Rejected, email inquiry 29 Feb
Stanford - Applied Physics Rejected, email 17 Feb

I was worried that my letter writers may not be well-known, but I'm glad to see that it has not really hindered me that much. On hindsight, it was the right thing to wait another year and try again. Good luck everyone!

Undergrad Institution: Arguably the top school in Canada. Probably comparable to a top 10-15 in the USA.
Major(s): physics and chemistry
Minor(s): math
GPA in Major: 3.75 (see below)
Overall GPA: 3.6 (see below)
Length of Degree:4 years
Position in Class: near top
Type of Student: Asian/Caucasian male, dual American/canadian citizen
GRE Scores:
Q: 93%
V: 97%
W: 99%
P: 900

Research Experience: 1 summer REU in nanotech, 1 summer reu at home university in quantum optics, research assistant in condensed matter lab for a semester, senior honours thesis.

Awards/Honors/Recognition: typical gpa awards and whatnot.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: peer tutor, grader for a few semesters.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Won an undergraduate writing competition in the humanities??

Special Bonus Points: 6/10 body, 8.5/10 face.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Long and confusing academic history. Went to an American school for 3 years, did mediocre with a 3.1 GPA as a math major, took a year off to clear my head, transferred into a better Canadian school and graduated with a ~3.93 at my new institution. The gpa I listed above is roughly the average gpa over my long college career which while decent given my strong improvement doesn't tell the whole story.

Applying to (all experiment):
MIT - AMO - rejected
Harvard - HEP - rejected
Princeton - HEP - rejected
Stanford - applied physics/materials science - rejected
Berkeley - HEP - rejected
UCSB - applied physics - accepted
Columbia - applied physics - accepted
University of British Columbia - HEP - accepted
Michigan Ann Arbor - HEP - accepted
UCSD - AMO - accepted
University of Toronto - AMO - accepted
Brown - AMO - rejected (LOL)

Don't be discouraged if you are off to a rough start. I did badly the first three years of college but it is never too late to show you are graduate school material. Doing well on the PGRE and in upper division courses will effectively dispel them of the notion you are not Ph.D material. I don't think my less than stellar beginning had much negative impact...maybe none at all. Admissions is very random and frequently students will be rejected even if they have excellent stats for seemingly no reason, but this is because schools have limited budgets - frequently schools accept people they think will actually *attend*, not necessarily the best applicants.

If you keep your gpa a 3.7+ and get over an 800 and have some decent research experience you should be able to get into a good program as long as you aren't too picky about location. If you aren't I would STRONGLY recommend applying to Canadian schools if you have a good but not amazing app. UBC and U of T have great programs that aren't terribly selective.

Undergrad Institution: small liberal arts, good overall but with a tiny unknown physics department
Major(s): Physics - concentration in Astrophysics
GPA in Major: 3.53/4.00
Overall GPA: 3.39/4.00 (split: first two years: 3.03; final two years: 3.77)
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: no idea
Type of Student: white female, both domestic & international (as I applied to schools outside of the States)

GRE Scores (old version, Jan 2010):
Q: 740/80%
V: 620/89%
W: 3.0/10% (???)
P: 480/7% - took in Nov 2010 & 2011 and got the exact same score both times

Research Experience:
Two unrelated projects:
1. A summer project, supervised, working on my advisor's research. Quantum mechanics, computational. Led to a publication.
2. My senior honors project, independent, not related to the research of any of the faculty at my school. Computational astrophysics - simulating the formation & evolution of globular stellar clusters.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Departmental Honors in Physics (the only one out of my graduating class; then again, there were only 5 of us), Sigma Pi Sigma, another physics award specific to my school (named after a former professor)

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: SPS President; lab TA, individual tutor, & help room (group tutoring) instructor

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Well, I'm pretty stubborn about this. There is info that might matter about why I had less than stellar grades (and really crappy grades for a while) and why I did badly on the PGRE, but I refused to include it on my application. If you want someone who's good at memorizing a bunch of stuff for a test, move along. If you want someone who's bad at standardized tests but is a good researcher, then my excuse for being bad at testing is irrelevant. (Neurological disorder, if you're all that curious.) I plan on spending the majority of my career doing research, not taking tests.


Applying to Where:

Edinburgh - Astronomy - Center for Computational Astrophysics
Glasgow - Physics - Institute for Gravitational Research Accepted via email 4.April without funding (the problem with international schools)
St. Andrew's - Physics Rejected via email 24.April
U. Washington - Astronomy Rejected via email 21.Feb
UC-Santa Cruz - Astronomy Rejected via email 10.Feb
U. Wyoming - Physics WaitlistedRejected via email 16.April
Washington State - Physics Accepted via email & snail mail 1.March w/TA offer - attending
U. Hawaii - Astronomy Rejected via snail mail 13.Feb

Plus the following master's programs:
Helsinki - Space Sciences Accepted via email 10.April without funding (though they also don't charge tuition in Finland)
Astromundus - Astronomy I guess. It's a joint program between 5 European universities. Accepted via email 25.May, offered full tuiton coverage + stipend 13.June. - wish they weren't so late with the offer; I might have attended but I'm not going to withdraw my acceptance at WSU.

My primary research interests are cosmology & computational astrophysics.

I should probably note that this is my second time applying to grad school (apparently I never posted my profile last year).

Now that my admissions saga is over, I will post this for posterity!

Undergrad Institution: Ivy
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): Biology
GPA in Major: 3.2
Overall GPA: 3.2
Length of Degree: 4
Position in Class: average
Type of Student: Domestic Hispanic male

Grad Institution: MSc, Poland, Marie-Curie Fellowship
Major(s): HEP
GPA: 4.5/5

GRE Scores (revised/old version): old version
Q: 780 (88%)
V: 720 (98%)
W: 5.5 (96%)
P: 710 (57%, 2nd try)

Research Experience:

    Undergrad: 3 years research
    3 years in applied physics lab
    1 talk, March Meeting
    1 paper in APL, 2nd author
    2 REUs
    Patent

    Postgraduate
    Marie Curie fellowship - mostly research, MSc courses on the side
    Many collaboration meeting presentations
    One major conference presentation + paper



Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Graduated from undergrad with honors in physics, 3-year Marie Curie research fellowship

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Lab TA, radio telescope operator, temped as scientific writer after graduation

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Basically, mediocre grades and GRE scores, but a lot of research.

Applying to Where: (in alphabetical order)
Accepted
Johns Hopkins University - Physics - HEP accepted with fellowship - will attend!
University of Pittsburgh - Physics - HEP accepted with fellowship
University of Wisconsin - Physics - HEP accepted with fellowship
Ohio State - Physics - HEP accepted
University of Virginia - Physics - HEP accepted

Rejected
Harvard - Physics - HEP - rejected
MIT - Physics - HEP rejected
UCSB - Physics - HEP rejected
CU - Boulder - Physics - HEP rejected
University of Maryland - College Park - Physics - HEP rejected
University of Pennsylvania - Physics - HEP rejected
University of Washington - Seattle - Physics - HEP rejected

Withdrawn
University of Iowa - Physics - HEP withdrawn early
University of Minnesota - Physics - HEP wait-listed, withdrawn


More acceptances with fellowships than without. My admissions profile, which was very focused on HEP, apparently resonated strongly with a few schools and not at all with most. Most rejections came very late.

Lessons on speaking with professors
I did get in touch with a few of the schools before applying. A professor from University of Iowa approached me at a conference about applying; I withdrew early out of respect for her once it was clear I had preferable options. I had a few emails with Johns Hopkins professors, University of Maryland professors, a professor from Pittsburgh, and even a informal Skype chat with a professor from UCSB. As you can see, my record of admissions for these schools is 50/50. From what I gathered, professors not on the admissions committee really don't have anything to do with the admissions process beyond telling the committee if they are looking for students or not.

In my experience, contacting professors is most useful to find out if they are looking for students, and as such it can be a big help in deciding where to apply. As for helping you get in, it won't have an effect unless the professor is really screaming for you to be admitted.

Undergrad Institution: Some foreign renowned institution in Turkey
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): no such concept, yet I took astrophysics classes
GPA in Junior year: around 3.3 / 4.0
Overall GPA: 2.84 / 4.00
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: below top
Type of Student: International male

GRE Scores (old version):
Q: 780
V: 420
W: 2.5
P: 840 (79%)

TOEFL Total (ibt): 106 (though, I'm quite sure I've done more rigorous job in GRE writing section)

Research Experience: Publication for undergrads, even doing some research, are not that possible here. However, I've substantially studied with my astrophysics instructor on pulsars.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: nope..

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Were TAing for many undergrad classes, still doing.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: nope..

Special Bonus Points: Well, my department is kind of reputed in US, many graduates are accepted to pursue PhD in fine US grad schools (as the most of the faculty once did). So, I can say that I have strong letters indicating my strong background.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Well, I've a studious SoP, I presume..I also have a musical background, which is directly responsible for my low grades in freshman-sophomore year. Though, rather than a grade inflation, there's some sort of grade depression for my department, considering 3.0 GPA is honored with a honors degree (people don't lock themselves into their room for two weeks weeping when they get a CC). Final comment on my GPA, I'm not sure for I would attract much attention unless my GPA were higher in my Junior year. And, I'm not sure if it helps, but I've taken many extra lectures including astrophysics, computational methods and programming.

Applying to Where:

University of Arizona - Physics - waitlist -
University of Virginia - Astronomy - rejected -
University of North Carolina at C.H. - Physics & Astronomy - waitlist -
University of Chicago - Physics - rejected -
Northwestern University - Physics & Astronomy - rejected -
University of Wisconsin at Madison - Physics - rejected -
University of Michigan at Ann Arbor - Astronomy - rejected -
Johns Hopkins University - Physics & Astronomy - rejected -
University of Illinois at U.C. - Astronomy & Astrophysics - rejected -
Notre Dame University - Physics & Astronomy - waitlist -

Pennsylvania State University - Astronomy & Astrophysics - rejected -
University of Pittsburgh - Physics & Astronomy - accepted - ~24k$ stipend TA - will ATTEND!
University of New Hampshire - Physics - rejected -
University of West Virginia - Physics - withdrawn -


Comments: In my SoP, I've mentioned that I mostly have theoretical background and I want to study computational astrophysics. Albeit I've mentioned that I am also keen on observational work, yet it seems that departments tend to be strict against you unless you want to work experimental, as it has always been..It might be the main reason for rejections. Anyhow, considering my low GPA in US standards, I am yet grateful to be able to pursue PhD, indeed. Best luck for all who wish so either.

My advice: If you're coming from a school that's well-known in physics but your record is less than stellar, consider avoiding private schools entirely. They get more applicants due to name recognition, so they're more likely to use your grades/scores to weed out your application before looking at where you came from and why your grades/scores might not be the best representation of your abilities without reading ever your recommendations, no matter how stellar they may be. State schools, especially those with less name recognition, are more likely to be impressed by your school's reputation and thus give your grades/scores less weight than your recommendations. Also, because state schools may feel that they are "used" as safeties by top students, a strong statement of purpose differentiating you from those who don't hold the school in high regard can probably be a big asset.
