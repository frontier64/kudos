I'll start things off with a mediocre profile

Undergrad Institution: Small private, top 30 Liberal Arts, not particularly well known for physics
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s):
GPA in Major: 3.14
Overall GPA: 3.23
Length of Degree: 4 years, second year attempting to get into grad school
Position in Class: low in department, above average across campus
Type of Student: domestic female

GRE Scores:
Q: 2008: 760 (85%), 2009: 780 (89%)
V: 2008: 620 (89%), 2009: 630 (90%)
W: 2008: 4.0 (41%), 2009: 3.5 (23%)
P: 2008: 570 (25%), 2009: 670 (48%)

Research Experience: 8 month project on asteroids as part of a class resulting in publication second author, 3 month summer internship at NASA GSFC analyzing HST images of M87 with no publication, 6 month independent paid research project analyzing Spitzer images of 3C 403 resulting in poster at AAS, will lead a project this spring on compact white dwarf binary system with publication expected

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: 2 large internal scholarships, SMART grant, small private scholarship

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: tutor and grader for one year, currently physics paraprof (TA) at my undergrad for 9 months

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

Special Bonus Points: I’m a chick? One of my recommenders went to Berkeley and still works closely with some of the faculty there

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I worked FULL TIME (35-40 hours per week) through all 4 years of college

Applying to Where:

I'm applying to Astronomy/Astrophysics with a general research interest in extragalactic or cosmology
Berkeley - Rejected 2/19 via email
UCLA - Rejected 2/18 via website
UC Santa Cruz - Rejected 2/27 via website
U of Washington - Rejected 2/8 via email
CU Boulder - Rejected 2/17 via snail mail
Arizona State - Accepted 1/27 via email
Oklahoma - Accepted 2/12 via email
Case Western Reserve - Accepted 1/29 via email - Will attend!
University of New Mexico - Accepted 2/10 via email

A word to future applicants: I applied to grad school last year and got rejected everywhere. I think that as physics people, we're all used to being the top of the top, so I was unwilling to compromise and apply to safety schools or not top 10 programs. In the end I suffered because of this decision. Over this past year, going through the whole application process again, I had to learn that good science comes from good scientists, not from brand name schools. If you are passionate about what you do and invest yourself completely, you will be successful regardless of the program you attend.

Undergrad Institution: International, well known in my city-state, otherwise unknown (except for the fact that they paid huge sums to woo a famous Nobel laureate in physics to reside here, though he doesn't teach; however, one of our ex-presidents, who was in electrical engineering, won the Nobel prize in physics recently)
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): Mathematics
GPA in Major: 3.95
Overall GPA: 3.66
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: Top
Type of Student: International, male

GRE Scores:
Q: 800
V: 450
W: 4.5
P: 990


TOEFL Total: 113

Research Experience: One in applied math, one in materials science, both at top institutions in the US (I later found that the big-name PI in materials science has a history of NOT writing recommendations for his interns, even his favorite ones; I end up not getting a letter from him and this is screwing me up :evil: :evil: :cry: ). Senior thesis project with vice-president of my university. (Remark: undergrad research in my country is rare, but I don't think the admissions committees would realize this)

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Numerous within school, none outside

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Zero extra-curricular activities, zero real job (Remark: it is almost impossible for an undergrad to get a TA/RA-type job in my country; plus, extra-curricular activities here are invariably stupid (don't want to elaborate) - we don't have one of those phi-beta-kappa type of stuff here. None at all. Again, I don't expect the admissions committees to understand the situation here.)

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

Special Bonus Points: A few grad classes (including a very challenging one which I took at a top US institution as an exchange student) with excellent grades; more extensive math background (analysis, differential geometry, some topology and some abstract algebra) compared to most physics majors; recommendation from the vice-president of my university (his PhD advisor decades ago was Murray Gell-Mann, he's an excellent physicist but I wonder if anyone would remember his name now).

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Haven't figured out yet, except for the absence of a recommendation from the materials science professor whom I worked with over the past summer. Screwing me up.

Applying to Where:

UIUC - Physics - Condensed matter theory/experiment - Rejected by email Apr 12
Stanford - Applied physics - Condensed matter theory/experiment - Rejected by snail mail Mar 10
Caltech - Applied physics - Condensed matter and materials science theory/experiment - Rejected by email Apr 1

Research Experience:
Research in experimental particle physics since May 2009 at my undergrad institution. I have helped in the development of a computer program that is of high interest in the ATLAS experiment. Gave a small presentation to a DOE representative but this was held in my professor's office so it was not a public thing. However, my professor informed me about this talk only a week before and it was right in the middle of finals. Therefore, the fact that I gave a good talk with such short notice is something I'm sure my professor will keep in mind as he writes me a recommendation.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: I have won a few scholarships that my physics professors have nominated me for but nothing all that significant.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: I have done tutoring in physics, math and general chemistry for over a year now.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: No, not really.

Special Bonus Points: I think my letters of recommendation will be quite good. I am currently taking a graduate class in Information Physics and will be taking another one in Computational Physics in the spring. One of my recommenders has a few connections at the schools I am applying to.

Undergrad Institution: Local Community College then degree from Midwest commuter state school. US. Not much of a reputation in physics, maybe nano stuff, nothing else.
Major(s):BS Physics
Minor(s):Math
GPA in Major:3.94
Overall GPA:3.95
Length of Degree: 3.5 years.
Position in Class: Top in a very small graduating class (maybe 5 total).
Type of Student: Domestic, dude, white, honkey. Are there any other adjectives that describe my utter lack of 'diversity'?

GRE Scores:
Q: 790
V: 580
W: 4.0
P: 790 (71%)




Research Experience: Absolutely none. We'll see how bad this one hurts, but I am interested in theory, maybe they are lenient on that. :|

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: A couple small scholarships for continuously good grades in physics.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Supplemental Instructor in math for a year at a community college.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

Special Bonus Points: I am sure I will have really good letters of recommendation from all three professors.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I hope that doing the degree in less than the normal time will help explain the lack of research done. I did at least two classes a summer and just booked on getting through the academic stuff because I started college 5 years later than most.

Applying to Where:

University of Michigan - Physics - Theory - Accepted by email 2/9 - Fellowship - Will Attend!
Michigan State - Physics - Theory - Contacted for Paid Visit - Accepted by mail 2/10 - Fellowship - Offer Declined
Washington University - St. Louis - Physics - Theory - Accepted by email 1/29 - TAship - Offer Declined
Caltech - Physics - Theory - Rejected by email 3/12
MIT - Physics - Theory - Rejected by email 3/2
Berkeley - Physics - Theory - Rejected by email 3/18
U Colorado - Boulder - Physics - Theory - Rejected by email 3/22



As a side note, I can delay my entry into grad school if I don't get into the top programs this year, it is not huge deal. But next year I absolutely have to go.


Note to next years applicants on MSU: That place was amazing. The faculty were crazy smart and all of the research fields were pretty interesting (and the school obviously had $$$). They were especially amazing in anything Nuclear. So if you like Nuclear stuff, apply here, the group of people they have there is very bright. The condensed matter people impressed me too. The CM people I talked to would be great to have as an advisor. I didn't talk to their HEP people much but they do have big connections with CERN and Fermilab. Bottom line is that it is an amazing place for experimentalists (they have a huge lab on campus), and a great place for theorists that are interested in heavily computational fields.

Special Bonus Points: Grad class in QFT this fall, will take grad classes in string theory and methods of mathematical physics in spring. Completed phy. coursework in two years (officially began in Fall 2008) while finishing engineering.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:

Applying to Where: All in HEP Theory

Texas - Physics - Invited to Open House, Email - 2/1; Accepted! Website, 3/1: 16.5k/9 months, plus insurance, tuition, etc. Will Attend!

UC Santa Barbara - Physics - Rejected, Website - 3/23

MIT - Physics - Rejected, Email - 3/2
Harvard - Physics - Rejected, Postal - 3/1
Princeton - Physics - Rejected, Email - 2/19
Cornell - Physics - Rejected, email - 2/11

Note for future applicants: I had verbal confirmation from two of my professors here at UT that I would be accepted. I really like the program here, so I only applied to schools that I knew I would like better, even if my odds of getting in were slim to none. Anyone with a similar profile to mine should strongly consider applying to schools that would be safer bets, though certainly not guaranteed (Columbia, Colorado, UIUC, Stony Brook, Penn, etc.). Had I to do it over again, I certainly would forgo MIT, Harvard, and Princeton for some of those and at least had some options for next year.

Research Experience: Four summers of research: two with a very well respected prof big in Lithium-ion batteries, did both theory and experiment (one publication in Journal of Physical Chemistry C, fourth author); another two with a less well known prof in polymer physics, did computational stuff and theory (submitted one paper to Europhysics Letters, first author, but it hasn't been accepted yet)

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Finished first overall at my university (not just in physics). I also won pretty much all the physics awards my department gives. But again, it's not a huge department. I also won a couple of fairly prestigious research scholarships from my university which supported two of my summers doing research.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Nothing really.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: I spoke at the Canadian Undergraduate Physics Conference twice, and got an honourable mention once.

Special Bonus Points: Like I said, one of my recommenders that I did research with is a pretty big name; I remember him being the only Canadian on some "highly cited" list.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Well, I didn't do as well on the PGRE last year (not that 810 is that bad). Also, I'm currently taking a year off, I'm not sure what departments think of that.

Applying to Where:

Harvard - Physics - Theory - Rejected
Princeton - Plasma Physics - Theory - Waitlisted - Rejected via email on 04/19
MIT - Physics - Theory - Waitlisted as of 04/28

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: some volunteer work (emphasized it in application)

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: one year of grad level research at Hvd.

Special Bonus Points: One recommended from the dept. at Hvd.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: i switched to physics at the beginning of sophmore year, i stressed the difficulties of no math or phys background i the app.

Applying to Where:
Harvard SEAS (applied physics)- accepted 2/25/10 via email $2,449 for 9 months Will Attend
Yale Applied Physics-phone interview 2/6/10... accepted 2/24/10 via email $31,500+$2,500 signing bonus
Michigan applied physics-accepted-25k 2 years + tuition/fees

NSF- denied

I have been referencing this site for a while so i thought i would offer some words for the wise.

1. the physics GRE is only offered 3 times a year. if you miss the November one you cant take it again until April (so dont miss it). If you do miss it like I did, all is not lost. The 3 schools i applied to do not require the physics gre. furthermore, students in Harvard SEAS can take all their classes through MIT or Harvard physics dept. One can even do their research and complete a thesis at MIT or Harvard phys. one just gets a diploma from SEAS. An advisor in the Harvard Physics dept. said that PGRE scores are not the be all end all, she said one year the admission committee even covered up the PGRE scores while choosing students.
2. Final note on the GRE. ETS says it takes 10 to 15 days to send scores. So one can technically take the test that many days in advance and still get the scores in on time.
3. from my experience talking to professors and admissions offers. Research is extremely important. make sure that you have strong research experience, with a good letter from your Principle Investigator and you should be good to go.

Some advice based on my experience: For schools with a late deadline, don't wait to apply. They likely do rolling admissions, and waiting will put you in the back of the line. I don't know if this hurt my chances at any schools, but it sure delayed some decisions.

Five years (summers and breaks) in a mechanical engineering lab (thin membranes) in my hometown (one summer as REU). Conference proceedings papers every year; I presented the latest one and am first author.


Awards/Honors/Recognitions:
Dean's List and some automatic, GPA-based honors for athletics
Physics Department Scholarships
National Merit Scholar
Athletic scholarship

Pertinent Activities or Jobs:
Undergraduate Teaching Fellowship - astro help center and telescope operator for student projects
I'm currently a Physics MS student at the same school (see "other info") so I'm a full TA - teach an E&M lab and grade for astronomy classes

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

Special Bonus Points:
I'm an athlete? They keep telling us that employers like athletes, so maybe grad schools do, too. Beats me.
At least one of my letters is very strong.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:
I stuck around as a masters student after getting my BS in order to use my final year of athletic eligibility, so I'm already a grad student who's taken grad courses, been a TA and done very well on a qualifying exam. I hope that helps.

Undergrad Institution: Caltech
Major(s): 2 Majors: Physics, Business Economics and Management - awarded 2008
Minor(s):
GPA in Major: 2.77 I think
Overall GPA: 3.0
Length of Degree: 4 yr
Position in Class: None calculated. Probably fairly low.
Type of Student: domestic white male

GRE Scores:
Q: 780 (oops)
V: 640
W: 4.5
P: 760

Research Experience:
-Asteroid observation and orbit determination, high school nerd camp.
-Work at a hydrogen battery company on a prototype summer before college.
-LIGO SURF the summer after my freshman year doing experimental physics on resonance and noise absorption / dissipation.
-Caltech surf in a plasma physics lab after my junior year - unfortunately, this didn't go so well. Still have my interest in this, however.
-Research in cosmology, simulating shear maps, and by extension, the 3d distribution of dark matter. This is the research that made me realize I wanted to go to grad school. Unfortunately, I started this at the end of my senior year and continued it up until:
-Work on a supernova finding telescope at Caltech. I've worked on this for about a year and a half since graduation. Papery goodness. And it's been a great experience.
-Observational astronomy with a doc at my job on some dwarf galaxy stuff.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Fred and Jean Felberg named SURF award, Eagle Scout, student leadership positions

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: I played water polo...

Special Bonus Points: In addition to working a full time position at this astronomy gig, I'm taking a graduate course at Caltech in plasma physics, which is super interesting.

Basically, I didn't think I'd be able to get into grad school coming straight out of Tech with my record and some things that went not so well, so I ended up taking two years off in order to find out what I like about science, whether I want to continue with it, and I think the answer is pretty obvious. SCIENCE.

And to see that life on the other side is, in fact, puppies, rainbows, and ponies like I was told it was. It is, it's pretty sweet.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I couldn't get a letter from the guy I worked with in the plasma physics lab. Considering I state in my application SOP that this is my interest, this is kind of a big one. Rather than beating around the bush, I took this head on, and flat out told them in my SOP / supplementals what happened and why. The same guy is teaching the plasma physics course that I'm taking now, so it's not like there are bad feelings or anything.

Applying to Where:
All are physics / plasma. Experimental probably. I want to get back to messing with things with my hands in addition to looking at accretion disks.

UT Austin - Invited to Open House Feb 3rd -> Accepted March 9 via status webpage
U of Iowa - Accepted unofficially with RA Feb 6th(on a kinda cool project, too!)

UCBerkeley - Rejection March 10 email

NSF -

To those of you out there waiting a year or two, or with a GPA like mine, don't give up! If you stick to it and you find out what truly interests you and engages you, then you can spend that time making an excellent case for yourself! Getting the research experience, showing you can think in that mindset and make real contributions, and finally, that you're not the kind of person to give up on a tough problem, or when things outside your control mess things up, matters a lot.

Position in Class: No idea...
Type of Student: domestic white female

GRE Scores:
Q: 790, 92%

why does it take so long? No answer whatsoever! I asked questions to various departments and they say they usually give answers mid march or that the process is "still going on". What should I understand by that? I saw that BU already sent acceptances and rejections. What means that? Why do they say nothing at all?

Advice Have safety schools. There are many good schools outside of the top ten that are easier to get in to but have professors doing equivalent levels of research. In grad school the name of the school doesn't matter as much as the name of the professor you're working with. Unless you really can get into all top ten schools getting into about half of the schools you apply to and getting rejected from half is pretty good.

Also, I think it is okay to go into grad school not knowing what type of physics you want to do. I applied to UC Boulder and didn't mention AMO in my SOP. I talked about potentially doing condensed matter or HEP. I think this gave me an advantage over the rest of the applicant pool who wanted to do AMO. I can still go there and do AMO if I decide I like it though.

Undergrad Institution: Big state, top 25 in physics
Major(s): Physics and Math
Minor(s): -
GPA in Major: 4.0
Overall GPA: 3.95
Length of Degree: 5 years
Position in Class: near top
Type of Student: domestic white male

GRE Scores:
Q: 800 (94th percentile)
V: 600 (86th percentile)
W: 5.5 (92nd percentile)
P: 800 (73rd percentile)



Research Experience:
1. Physics REU at big state school
2. Engineering REU at big state school
3. Research at my school. Worked with the professor last year, this past summer, and this year. Project will culminate in my senior thesis. This research will lead to two papers, one of which was submitted when I was filling out applications (just actually published in last month). Another paper that is being written. 2nd of 3 authors on both.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Awards within my physics department

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: tutoring

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

Special Bonus Points: taking grad classes this year

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Went to conference at MIT and met several professors in quantum computing

Applying to Where:

Boston University - Physics - high energy theory (HET) Accepted by email 1/27: TA offer initially, Fellowship offered 3/12 Accepted Offer
UC Berkeley - Physics - HET or quantum computing (QC) Rejected by email 3/10
MIT - Physics - HET or QC Rejected by email 3/2
Univ of Minnesota - Physics - HET Accepted by email 2/3: TA offer initially, Fellowship offered 3/15 Declined Offer
Harvard - Physics - HET Rejected by mail late February

NSF Fellowship Awarded Fellowship on 4/6 Accepted Fellowship
NDSEG Fellowship Rejected by email 4/15
DOE Office of Science Fellowship Semifinalist (no $) by email 4/19

Free Advice:
1. Study a lot for the physics gre the summer before taking it, focus on the practice tests. I feel I did a good job preparing for grad school BUT my physics GRE was low for the top schools.
2. On a vacation? Visit some schools, even ones you'd never considered. I stopped by Boston University on a whim and was impressed by the professors and now I will be attending there next year.
3. Want to hear more of my advice? Check out my profile for my blog.

Note to Future Posters:
I recommend included your test percentile since it changes significantly year to year.
