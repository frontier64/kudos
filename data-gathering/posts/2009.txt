Undergrad Institution: US Liberal Arts, prestigious in general (top 10) but not particularly in physics
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): Math, Computer Science
GPA in Major: 3.89
Overall GPA: 3.72
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: Near top (or top maybe, I don't know) of physics majors, not amazing overall (top third or so)
Type of Student: Bland domestic white male

GRE Scores:
Q: 800 (94%)
V: 620 (89%)
W: 4.5 (58%)
P: 910 (88%)

Research Experience: Two REUs, and two research projects at my school. One article in press with me as bajillionth author, one first author paper submitted. Two other first author papers 'in preparation', and 3 papers with me as author 4-5 or so also 'in preparation'. My name has been on several conference posters (but mostly way far down the author list), and I presented one at APS.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: School departmental physics awards, our equivalent of the Dean's List, Sigma Xi.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: TA for 2 lab classes

Special Bonus Points: Connections to UCLA and Berkeley through research. I think two letters of rec should be very positive, and I have two others that should be good (one from each research adviser).

Applying to Where:
I'm not entirely sure what I want to do - either AMO or plasma experiment, but I'm leaning towards plasma. I've worked on research projects involving both, so I can sell myself as either at the moment.
MIT - Physics - Plasma experimental - Accepted 2/17 by mail, ABB-MIT fellowship (21k/9mo for the first year). [Will attend]
Princeton - Plasma Physics - Plasma experimental - Interviews 1/30, 2/9. Accepted 2/24 by e-mail (22k/9mo fellowship + 8k summer RA). [declined]

Maryland - Physics - Plasma/AMO experimental - Accepted 2/27 by e-mail (30k JQI Fellowship). [declined]
UCLA - Physics - Plasma experimental - Accepted 2/20 by e-mail, (20k/9mo fellowship + option to TA/RA). [declined]
Wisconsin - Physics - Plasma experimental - Accepted 1/30 by e-mail (17.5k TA/RA + 1k fellowship) [declined]
Harvard - Physics - AMO experimental - Rejected 2/24 after I asked via e-mail.
Stanford - Physics - AMO experimental - Accepted 2/27 by e-mail (32k TA/RA). [declined]
Caltech - Physics - AMO experimental - Accepted 2/11 by e-mail (26k RA). [declined]
Boulder - Physics - AMO experimental - Accepted 2/20 by e-mail (~20k TA/RA + 10k 'signing bonus' fellowship). [declined]

Screw you Harvard, almost a clean sweep. I was definitely not expecting this...

Fellowships:
NSF - Limbo, then awarded 5/18.
NDSEG - Rejected 3/31 by e-mail.
DOE NNSA SSGF - Awarded 4/8 by e-mail. [Accepted fellowship.]

Major(s): Physics and Mathematics
Minor(s): None
GPA in Major: Physics: 3.55, Math: 3.36
Overall GPA: 3.39
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: Top fifth
Type of Student: Domestic white male

GRE Scores:
Q: 740
V: 560
W: 5
P: Really, really bad...

Research Experience: Independent projects since sophomore year. Physics REU at SUNY Stony Brook in summer of 2008 (theoretical solid state -- heat conduction in molecular dynamics). Senior research in thin film hydrogen absorption (abstract submitted by advisor for presentation at 2009 APS March Meeting -- I am listed as the second author).

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Sigma Pi Sigma, Pi Mu Epsilon, 2008 Mary Reklis Award for Physics (college honor).

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Graded algebra based intro physics homework sophomore year. Teaching assistant for calculus based intro physics recitation sessions since sophomore year. Last year and this year I am tutoring/TAing for both algebra based and calculus based intro courses. Also work as a one-on-one tutor, as well as an "on-call" type tutor for math and physics at a help center on campus (since junior year). Have also had other jobs including telemarketing for university donations and at a computer tech support center.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Nothing really that I haven't already included.

Special Bonus Points: Probably only that my advisor for senior research has been very active with publications/collaborations lately. Also applying to a lot of the universities those who are writing recommendation letters attended. One of the professors writing me a letter of recommendation just published a textbook in linear algebra that is getting a good reception. It is already being adopted at quite a few colleges in the US.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: My general chemistry grades might not be so good, considering I want to get into experimental condensed matter.

Applying to Where:

SUNY Stony Brook - Physics - Condensed Matter Experiment
University of Minnesota - Physics - Condensed Matter Experiment Rejected 02/18/2009 by e-mail
Ohio State University - Physics - Condensed Matter Experiment

Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): Math
GPA in Major: 3.6

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Studied in England for a semester

Special Bonus Points: None

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:

Applying to Where:

Cornell - Applied Physics - CME Rejected 3/5 by email
Berkeley - Physics- CME Rejected 3/16 by email
UCSB - Physics- CME Decided not to apply
UCSC - Physics - CME Rejected 3/5 by email
Boulder - Physics- CME Rejected 3/10 by email
UWash - Physics- CME Rejected 4/7 by email
UOregon - Physics - CME waitlisted 3/12 then rejected 4/15
Colorado School of Mines - Physics- CME waitlisted
UDelaware - Physics- CME Accepted!!! 1/9 by email with $30k IGERT PV fellowship

Things didn't work out quite as hoped, with only one acceptance and a lot of money wasted on rejections. I think I aimed too high, got bad GRE scores (I was expecting at least 800) and had a tough year. For future applicants I recommend taking the GRE early so you will have time to retake, or at least some indication of where you can get in. Also be careful deciding on safety schools, I thought mines, oregon and del would all be safe and I would probably get into UCSC. Turns out I only got into del, which has good research in what I want to do (PV) but weak in overall physics. Good luck to all future applicants!

I'm in a slightly unusual situation, so I don't know how much help it'll be overall...

Undergrad Institution: State engineering school
Major(s): Applied Physics
Minor(s): Applied Math
GPA in Major: 3.85ish
Overall GPA: 3.79
Length of Degree: 4.5 years
Position in Class: Near if not at the top for physics students, no clue rest of university
Type of Student: American as apple pie female

GRE Scores:
Q: 740
V: 570
W: 4.5
P: reaaaaaaaally bad :(



Research Experience: Summer REU 2007, independent study/minor lab work this past summer that wasn't quite as productive as I'd have hoped...

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Honors college, Outstanding UG Student Award.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: SPS VP, tutored physics and pre-calc, Physics I homework TA last semester. Also help run weekly journal/physics topic discussion group.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Very active within the department (open houses, accepted student days, etc) and was on committee for programs for first year women students the past year.

Special Bonus Points: I hate to say it, but being female is probably all I got going :oops: I also already got to visit the lab I am interested in working with, but I don't think they have any say in admissions....

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Well I obviously didn't put this on my application but I am locked to the NJ/NYC area due to my fiance's job. In addition, since I graduate this month I was trying for a spring admission so depending on how that goes I'll either update with ACCEPTED! or some other schools for my "round two" applications - I should find out within a few weeks!

Applying to Where:

Rutgers - Physics - HEP Experimental (spring 2009) ACCEPTED 1/9 with TA position

Undergrad Institution: Engineering school in Argentina, 2nd in the country, no physics
Major(s): electromech engineering
Minor(s):
GPA in Major:
Overall GPA: 8.55/10.00 (yeah, grade deflation. This is endemic in my country where, in practice, there are no 10s. Plus, I hated some engineering stuff!!)

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: I was hired by the experiment to fill in a permanent researcher position.

Special Bonus Points: I've been working with somebody from the UWisc faculty for over 3 years now and this Professor has kindly invited me to join his group. He might even be a part of the admission committee. I could have gotten a recommendation letter from a Nobel Prize winner but I was told not to look for it as it would have "overdone" the application a little bit (man, I'm regretting not asking it now, what an idiot I am!!). some language skills that could be useful in an int collab: italian, spanish, english and some french

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I really do love astrophysics! (I hope this will show up)

Applying to Where:

University of Wisconsin-Madison - Astroparticle physics ACCEPTED with TA/RA ~ 24k (01/20) Will attend (duh!)

Length of Degree: 5 years (lots of ups and downs - no easy or short path for me)
Position in Class: ?
Type of Student: the same as the previous institution

GRE Scores:
Q: 780(90%)
V: 660(94%)
W: 5(77%)
P: 640(42%) Awful - I have terrible test taking anxiety like a number
of dudes here - I should probably get my self diagnosed so I can get double
time, although that just sounds wrong. It's been with me since I can remember.
Hopefully it won't cause me to wait another year.

Research Experience:
I did do a masters thesis and its contents were talked about on a poster :).

Pertinent Activities or Jobs:
Tutor for 8+ years in math and physics. TA for more than 2 years.

Special Bonus Points:
Not to my knowledge. I've finished an MS at a not so rigorous institution as
opposed to others who have finished a BS (or even an MS) from a competitive
institution - not saying that what I did was easy, but most likely comparable
to these undergraduate classes and no higher.

Like many I have a lot of computing skills, but if one is serious about physics
then it appears highly probable that one acquires these skills. So I am not too
certain how different I am to others in this area.

Minor(s): political science
GPA in Major: 3.9 in physics, ~3.6 or 3.7 in math
Overall GPA: 3.80
Length of Degree: 5 years
Position in Class: 1st, 2nd or 3rd in class
Type of Student: domestic female

GRE Scores:

Q: 670
V: 590
W: 5
P: 530 :oops:

Research Experience:

Lots of experience starting as a sophomore. Did some internships that were quite good, and spent last year and half working on general relativity/mathematical physics project.

Numerous presentations including national conferences, Posters on Capitol Hill, APS meetings, student conferences. Will be taking current research to gravity meeting and SPS zone meeting in the spring to give a talk.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions:

New exciting award! I'm the College of Science Undergrad. Researcher of the Year for 2008!!! :D
Rhodes Scholar Finalist
Goldwater Honorable Mention
APS award for best presentation at meeting
Undergraduate Research Fellowship from my university
Some smaller scholarships and 4 year academic scholarship from my institution as well. Hopefully will get NSF fellowship!?

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Was secretary of SPS chapter for a year, member of Sigma Pi Sigma, member of reputable undergrad. research team that launches stuff into space via NASA (really well-known in some circles), designed & led experiment for NASA's Vomit Comet program, graded ODEs and introductory modern physics for 2 semesters. Am now teaching an introductory physics lab.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Two graduate math classes (multilinear algebra and differential geometry) and graduate physics class ... there's lots else, but none going in the applications (not physics related)

Special Bonus Points: No connections, no famous people. But I'm a female, maybe that will help? And my letters will be quite good, because all my recommenders know me very well and are based on good research.

If only I could explain that despite my PGRE and QGRE, I actually spend my free time reading Misner, Thorne and Wheeler's "Gravitation", manipulating solutions to the Einstein equations, and computing Killing vector fields and isometry groups. I can't remember polygons, but I can do tensors!! :!: WTF??

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:

Undergrad Institution: Medium-sized state school. Not a particularly well-known school, but in my experience those who do know of our program have a favorable impression.
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): Math
GPA in Major: 3.87 (Increased to 3.89 after Fall 2008, updated transcript sent)
Overall GPA: 3.72 (Increased to 3.75 after Fall 2008, updated transcript sent)
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: Unknown, but probably top 15% or above
Type of Student: Domestic white male

GRE Scores:
Q: 730 (79%)
V: 630 (90%)
W: 4.5 (58%)
P: 750 (66%)

Research Experience:
A year of research at my own school plus 2 REUs at different schools (all on topics which could be considered experimental condensed matter). Combined research resulted in two conference presentations, one submitted paper for publication, and two papers ‘in preparation’, but nothing published yet.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Scholarship, Dean’s List, and something which could be loosely classified as an external award for ‘science tutoring’.

Special Bonus Points: Letters of recommendation from each of my three research advisors. Although I do not know what they wrote, all three letters should be good, and (at least in theory) they could even be very good to excellent. At one of the school I am applying to I have prior experience conducting research with the professors who heads the graduate admissions committee and also wrote one of my letters of recommendation.

Applying to Where:

In all cases, I am applying to the Physics department for Experimental Condensed Matter

Undergrad Institution: Technical University, Top 20 depending who you ask
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): History
GPA in Major: 3.1 (see "additional info")
Overall GPA: 3.21
Length of Degree: 4.5 years (due to study abroad)
Position in Class: Finishing towards the top
Type of Student: domestic female

GRE Scores:
Q: 720
V: 550
W: 5.0
P: 500 (12%) :?

Research Experience: Been working for the high-energy astrophysics group on my campus for 2.5 years on a gamma ray detector and the "big cosmic ray collaboration" as metric put it (hi!), completed senior thesis on designing/building a Cherenkov radiation detector for said group, REU this past summer working on a radio telescope array

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: national award in science writing, science journalist of the month for the publication I've worked for, "Service Award" from my physics department for all the stuff I've done there

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: TA for intro physics course, SPS President, telescope operator for public observing nights... I'm also a science writer- "geek" column in uni newspaper, have published nationally and attended scientific conferences for that, have worked 2 years as a science journalist for an undergrad research journal.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: have hosted departmental colloquia and lots of help with department outreach

Special Bonus Points: One grad class (classical mechanics), will have great letters, including one from a very famous astronomer

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I realize the GPA is on the low side if you just look at the number- basically I wasn't doing so hot my first few years, but pulled things together and have gotten straight As for ~2 years now. I'm banking a lot on a grad committee not worrying too much about the "C" in introductory E&M if I got an "A" in the advanced version, stuff like that. Not happy with the PGRE obviously, but recommenders will be addressing it.

Also, um, I'm spending my next six months doing a trip around the world. My application wasn't eclectic enough.

Applying to Where:

Boston University - Astronomy - Experiment rejected
University of Massachusetts - Astronomy - Experiment rejected
Yale - Astronomy - Experiment rejected
Columbia - Astronomy - Experiment never heard back
Rutgers - Physics - Experimental Astrophys rejected
Johns Hopkins - Physics - Experimental Astrophys never heard back
University of Maryland - Astronomy - Experiment never heard back
Case Western Reserve University - Physics - Experimental Astrophys accepted, $22k TAship
University of Chicago - Astronomy/Physics - Experiment rejected
University of California- Berkeley - Astronomy - Experiment rejected
University of California- Santa Cruz - Astronomy/Physics - Experiment rejected

Proof that all you need is one! :wink: Also not sure why three schools never answered me despite emails, I didn't find it particularly kind of them.

Undergrad Institution: Private university, good reputation in physics.
Major(s): Astrophysics
GPA in Major: 3.50
Overall GPA: 3.52 (I don't see how you guys have higher GPAs in your majors! All of the other non-physics/astronomy classes I have taken are cake compared to major courses.)
Length of Degree: 4 year.
Position in Class: I have no clue. It's difficult to rank because a B in physics is a good grade here, whereas lower than an A in English is unacceptable. I'm top amongst physics-peers.
Type of Student: (Domestic/International, male/female, minority?) Female, white... magical... j/k

GRE Scores: (MEH!)
Q: 730, 79%
V: 600 85%
W: 4.5 58%
P: 670 49%

I make no excuses, I just didn't study.

Research Experience: I have worked with multiple professors at my university, and I am currently working on unprecedented cutting edge research with a brand new instrument, which will probably publish... but not in time for applications. I also had an REU, and I will present this work at the upcoming AAS meeting.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: I don't know of any awards at my school, and I haven't applied for external ones.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: I graded for classes?

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: I gave a guest lecture to a high school astronomy class and it was super fun!

Special Bonus Points: I do have excellent letters of recommendation, written by prominent scientists in their fields.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: My GRE scores do kind of suck. My GPA also might appear to suck, but it's quite respectable coming from my institution.

Research Experience: None. I Never considered physics too seriously until I left school... Spent a lot of time reading the "Feynman Lectures on Physics" and the Encyclopedia Britannica to prepare for the Physics GRE after school.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Nothing

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Burned cement aggregates in a furnace for money

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Gave a seminar on the fundamental theorem of differential equations on complete normed linear spaces (Banach spaces) to obtain undergrad math degree

Special Bonus Points: I may have some enthusiastic recommendations

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Mixed record with some A's in advanced mathematics and physics courses. Focused (if you could call it that) on mathematics as an undergrad and managed a 540 on the GRE math subject test. Took some time off after taking a few graduate courses in mathematics and eventually got the itch for physics.

Northern Illinois U - Physics - Condensed matter Accepted by email on 02/05/2009, partial TA position w/tuition waver - Accepted Offer

NDSEG Fellowship - Physics Rejected by email on 03/31/09
______________________________________________

Notes: Given my below average GPA and lack of research experience, I would say I was lucky to get in anywhere. As a side note, I took several graduate courses in math at NIU. My graduate advisor at the time was willing to write me a recommendation for my second attempt at graduate school, which probably helped me out immensely in being offered a spot at NIU.

Undergrad Institution: University of Pittsburgh (in top 50)
Major(s): Physics and Astronomy
GPA in Major: 3.3

Research Experience: Research at the Allegheny Observatory studying near-earth asteroids and extrasolar planets

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Undergraduate Writing Award
Emil Sanielevici Research Scholarship co-recipient

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: I'm taking graduate stellar structure this spring. Also I have experience teaching in public schools

Special Bonus Points: Met with Dr. David Charbonneau, transiting exoplanet prof from Harvard, one-on-one when he was visiting Pitt and got to show him the scope I'm using for my research

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: 31 year old single mom who's overcome a lot of financial and societal constraints to earn this degree.

UC Riverside--Physics--observational astrophysics--accepted ~$22k
University of Florida--Astronomy--extrasolar planetsrejected
University of Minnesota--Astronomy--stellar astronomyaccepted ~$16k
University of Pittsburgh--Physics and Astronomy--whatever they'd let me do (this is my backup school, since there is very little research going on for stellar astronomy; it's almost all large-scale structure, but they might let me continue doing exoplanet research anyway since I did undergrad here and have a rapport with many of the faculty)accepted ~$22k

As you might guess, my tactic is to blitz tons of schools so that I can get in somewhere, since I have a really bad PGRE score, and only mediocre GPA. But I'm hoping my research experience and the strength of my letters will help get me in somewhere.

dustdevil

    (I don't see how you guys have higher GPAs in your majors! All of the other non-physics/astronomy classes I have taken are cake compared to major courses.)



I TOTALLY agree! I mean, I always make fun of humanities classes for being way way too easy. I got A's in pretty much all of them without even trying so I don't get how so many people do worse in overall GPA than in major GPA. I mean, to me, that's what makes our major so awesome: it's challenging and intellectually stimulating; it wouldn't seem rewarding to me if it came too easily... I'd be bored to tears like I am in humanities courses.

Undergrad Institution: UC Berkeley
Major(s): Physics and Applied Math
Minor(s): Nope
GPA in Major: 3.71 in physics, 3.6ish in math
Overall GPA: 3.63
Length of Degree: 4 (graduated May '08)
Position in Class: Um. No idea. Decent?
Type of Student: Domestic white female

GRE Scores:
Q: 800 (94%)
V: 680 (96%)
W: 5.5 (90%)
P: 870 (84%)

Research Experience: Didn't know I wanted to go to grad school until my last semester. Now I can't get any research experience because I have no research experience. Yeah, that makes sense.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Dean's List once... this is the problem with going to a school where you have to get a 4.0 to be on the honor roll. National Merit before? I don't think that counts.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: The reason I want to go to grad school. I tutored physics for 8 semesters, taught a study group (basically a discussion session) for 5 semesters. I really, really want to teach physics. Also, reader for one semester, private tutoring, math workshop leader for two summers....

Special Bonus Points: I... am female? I think my SoP was pretty decent.

Applying to Where:
All for theory, CMT especially, except where noted...
Stanford- Rejected (email 2/26), probably would have had difficulties being surrounded by stanfurd people anyway
Cal Tech- Rejected (email 2/27)
UChicago- Rejected (mail 3/7)
Cornell- Rejected (email 2/11)
Maryland- also Physics Education, ACCEPTED (email 3/5), TA. Offer accepted!
UCSD- ACCEPTED (email 3/2), TA. Offer declined.
UW- also Physics Education, ACCEPTED (email 1/16), TA. Offer declined, which was really really difficult to do.

Type of Student: Domestic white male

GRE Scores:
Q: 780 (90%)
V: 530 (68%)
W: 4.5 (54%)
P: 870 (84%) - Also took the test last year and scored 720 (60%)

Research Experience: No publications, but I've been working as a research assistant in a nuclear lab on campus for about 3 years writing various kinds of software to fit the needs of the researchers. I've also been working in an observational cosmology research group headed by someone pretty well-known for the past year. The cosmo stuff has been odds-and-ends as well: system administration, writing image analysis code that nobody else has gotten around to, etc. Did a senior thesis in computational physics with a dude that's pretty well-known in his field.

I feel the same way as conunDrum, I originally had UCLA, Madison, Cornell, NYU, and Columbia, on my app, but I took them off after the horrible PGRE score, but now thinking about it, I should have just went for it, if they want to reject them that's fine, or at least that's what I should have told myself. Oh well, for now It looks like I'll give going to Minnesota, which I am happy about.

Undergrad Institution: Large Public
Major: Physics BS
Masters: Math MS
GPA in Major: ~3.85
Overall GPA: 3.85
Length of Degrees: 4 years combined
Position in Class: near top in physics, not sure exactly where
Type of Student: domestic male

GRE Scores:
Q: 800
V: 650
W: 5.5
P: 990 (but this was on a second testing, which may have arrived late to schools)

Research Experience: Some research with a prof, in a field not very related to my interests; no publication, but hopefully the rec will say I contributed substantially to the HEP experiment that will result. Also an independent study which another prof generously called research, and which will hopefully also lead to a good rec.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Couple of school awards (one for physics teaching), but nothing fancy.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: This Spring I am a TA, but I had to try and get that added to my apps after submission since it only became official in mid-January.

Special Bonus Points: I'm applying for some variation on HEP Theory, so hopefully my MS in math will be a plus. Also, a large number of grad physics classes (I will be finished with my school's graduate QM and QFT courses when I graduate).

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: One of my recs was from a math prof. Hope that wasn't a mistake...

Note to future applicants: say why your prior research is important, even if it is not relevant to your proposal, and try to have tangible outcomes from research beyond a positive rec.)

Length of Degree: 5
Position in Class: tied at top with someone else
Type of Student: International Male

GRE Scores:
Q:800
V:670
W:4.5
P:800 (74 %)


TOEFL Total: waived – did my undergrad in the US

Research Experience:
a lot of research at my school, worked several professors at the same time for several years. Schoolwork was too easy.

Symmetry Analysis: two peer reviewed publications. First paper, 2nd author out of three; second paper, 2nd author out of two. Tier 1 journals.
-Two more papers currently being written

Control Theory (control of plasmas): one peer reviewed publication, 1st author out of two. Top journal in the field. Very good paper I might add.

Control Theory (biophysics/mathematics): One paper currently being written.

Functional Analysis (Spectral Theory): Interesting but no publication here.

General Relativity: Kaluza-Klein theory, and Mach's principle, again no publications here, but learned a whole lot; 3 years of it.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions:
Many in school ones, all the usual plus outstanding graduating senior in mathematics

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Worked as a researcher as often as I could get paid for it – otherwise I did it pro-bono.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:
Many public presentations (all on my original research)
-3 poster presentations at Joint National Conferences of MAA and AMS
(won outstanding poster at all three – apparently pretty rare)
-2 talks at conferences, one national, and one Regional
-A couple of local presentations


Special Bonus Points: Took an insane amount of classes. Grad Classes in Symmetry Analysis, Control Theory, and Nonlinear PDE's.

Also Took many independent studies with professors: 2 Semesters of Differential Geometry, 2 Semesters of General Relativity, and 1 semester Topology

Oh, and really good letters of rec. I did alot of research and took classes with all of them.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:
Computer skills: 1 class short of computer science minor
-Several Programing Languages including C++

Also, I come from a country that does not produce many Physicists or Mathematicians: Honduras. So I doubt that many Honduran's have attended the departments I've applied to, if any at all. I don't know if this is good or bad.

Applying to Where:

When it comes to research interest I'm leaning towards fundamental interaction or High Energy Physics, but ultimately undecided

Undergrad Institution: Cambridge England, good rep for physics
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): Dont have that concept
GPA in Major: 1st (UK system)
Overall GPA: 1st (UK system)
Length of Degree: 5 years, but with an M.Sci - most people get it after 4 though
Position in Class: Top third or quarter
Type of Student: International (irish + british)
GRE Scores:
Q: 790 (92nd%)
V: 510 (64th%)
W: 4.0 (36th%)
P: 870 (84th%)


TOEFL Total: didnt need

Research Experience: Queens university belfast (aero engineering), ETH zurich (astrophysics) both about 2-3 months. No publications, not yet at least - some possibility of future publication

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Really just stuff for getting good grades in cambridge

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Tutored a lot during high school but not really since

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

[b]Special Bonus Points: Probably not enough of these - I opted for less well known recommenders who know me well. This may not have been such a good idea in hindsight! Had secured a scholarship for Penn which pays everything for first two years. This is completely independent of the department, and i had been offered the scholarship before they offered me the place (and they knew about the scholarship).

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:the fact I left cambridge for a year may be a bit dodgy since it doesn't happen often

Cornell - CME - rejceted
Harvard - CME - rejected
Princeton - CME - rejceted
Stanford - CME - rejected
UPenn - CME - accepted (not sure if I am gonna go or not yet)

With all the rejections I feel like I may have been punching above my weight with the top four on my list, I'm not sure. I am considering reapplying next year, but all I can feasibly do is improve my GRE score, and possibly get a publication or at most two. Is there much point in this? I don't mind taking the time out, infact I would quite like to, but how much better are the other four places than UPenn anyway (I am definately considering CMT instead of CME by the way)?

Undergrad Institution: small school in Hong Kong, physics department is reasonably famous for solid state/astro, no one in biophysics - so I have to do a few internships in California
Major(s): Physics, Math
Minor(s): Statistics
GPA in Major: 3.97
Overall GPA: 3.90
Length of Degree: 3 years
Position in Class: top 1 among some 40 students
Type of Student: International

GRE Scores:
Q: 800 (94%)
V: 700 (97%)
W: 6.0 (96%) (I write for pleasure)
P: 990 (95%)
M(Sub Math): 900 (99%) (I always do better in math)

Research Experience:
1st author in small journal with a UCSF professor, on system biology of the cell cycle (theory/modeling)
paper in preparation with a Stanford Applied Physics group, in molecular biophysics (theory/simulation)
other unpublished reviews/small projects with various professors at my own university

Awards/Honors/Recognitions:
bunches of awards at my university for having high GPA

Special Bonus Points:
Graduate coursework in quantum mechanics, stat mech, ODE, PDE, probability theory, machine learning, and nonlinear control. As said, went to labs at UCSF and Stanford as interns and got recommendations. Now in UC Berkeley as an exchange student (which is where I took half of those grad classes).
I also translated volumes of poetry into English from their original ancient Chinese. But I guess that didn't help much. :oops:

Special Weaknesses:
Not a single college-level course in biology. :shock: I'm too busy taking math/physics classes & doing research. My biology is self-taught, but apparently little-recognized. I also suffer from a severe case of megalomania. As you see:

Applying to Where:
Princeton - Physics -> Quantitative & Computational Biology (QCB) - rejected [ALMOST made it :lol: ]
Harvard - Biophysics - rejected :?
MIT - Computational and Systems Biology (CSBi) - rejected :(
Stanford - Statistics :shock: - rejected :cry:
Brown - Applied Math :shock: - rejected :? :cry:
NYU - Computational Biology - rejected :x
UCSF - Bioinformatics - waitlisted :roll: and rejected :cry:
Caltech - Applied Physics - accepted from the waitlist on April 16th 8)

I missed the deadlines of Berkeley. :oops:

And yeah, I admit I'm more than a bit insane. But just sane enough to stay out of an asylum. :lol:

Undergrad Institution: UC Berkeley
Major(s): Electrical Engineering / Computer Science
Minor(s): n/a
GPA in Major: 2.9
Overall GPA: 2.9
Length of Degree: 4 (graduated '07)
Position in Class: probably average
Type of Student: domestic asian male

GRE Scores:
Q: 800
V: 740
W: 4.0
P: 740

Research Experience: Spent a summer during undergrad building a detector; continued with the group and was hired after graduating to build electronics. Group does nuclear physics.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Nothing in college.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: See Research -- I've been working in research since I graduated in '07.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Not really. Took some upper div Physics classes, but not enough for a minor.

Special Bonus Points: ?

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Just to sum things up, I'm going from EE to Physics, and my GPA is lousy. My recommenders are my PI, plus two professors in the EE department whose classes I actually got As in. (But those classes are considered some of the most challenging in the department.)

Applying to Where:

MIT - Plasma Exp - nope
UT Austin - Plasma Exp (MS) - nope
Maryland - Plasma Exp (MS) - nope
Indiana Bloomington - Beam/Accel (MS) - nope
Northern Illinois University - Beam/Accel (MS) - accepted w/TA, declined offer
Illinois Institute of Tech - Beam/Accel (MS) - accepted w/TA, will attend
Stony Brook - MS in Instrumentation - accepted? (no communication / miscommunication?, had to decline)

Sorry for the navel-gazing, but here's some additional thoughts:

Strategy: My main interest is experimental plasma physics / fusion, and my goal is to get into a PhD program that actually has a fusion device, like a tokamak or a stellarator. With my grades, though, I figured it'd be nearly impossible to get into those schools. So I applied to Masters programs in beam physics, which is related to plasma physics.

Analysis: I'm satisfied with how things turned out. Since I wasn't a physics major in undergrad, now I've got the opportunity to patch up areas I didn't take classes in. For 2011 I expect to apply again to PhD programs. And to have cured my laziness.
