Undergrad Institution: Current bachelor's: Large state school, OK physics, spectacular astronomy. First bachelor's: top-30 large private university.
Major(s): Physics. First degree: Business and English.
Minor(s): Math.
GPA in Major:
Overall GPA: 3.72, magna cum laude (Latest degree), 3.47 (First degree)
Length of Degree: (Are you graduating after 3, 4, or 5 years?) 2.5 + 4 for the first bachelor's
Position in Class: ~90%
Type of Student: Domestic white female

GRE Scores :
Q: 161 (88%)
V: 164 (87%)
W: 5.5 (98%) (yes mom, you read that right)
P: attempt 1: 580 (24%), attempt 2: 670 (44%)


Research Experience:
2+ years with the same professor in Cosmology (my entire time I've been in school for physics)
1 year in computational astrophysics (concurrent with the above while it lasted)
1 year + in experimental biophysics (hello) (concurrent with the two projects above)
1 REU in computational radio astronomy
1 REU in cosmology (computational and instrumentation)

1 publication in prep :eyeroll:
4 posters
5 talks

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: 2 merit-based awards in science/physics, 1 award for scholarship and character from a national lab, best undergraduate poster, 4.0 GPA congratulatory kudos, departmental award from my literature department during my first degree

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Officer in two physics minority engagement clubs, I've done a bunch of outreach, volunteered at a cancer hospital for a year, have volunteered as an observer for a cosmological survey for a significant number of nights

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Fluent in Russian, which comes in handy more often than I'd expected. I take acting and improv classes and actively work on my public speaking skills, so my talks generally receive praise. I have a massive amount of writing experience compared to most applicants. Oh, and two years of full-time work experience (as a writer).

Special Bonus Points: two grad classes (1 was ultra-relevant to my grad school interest, completed with an A; the other is one of those courses physics grad students take in their first year. Grade TBD). Female. I have 6 eager recommenders and have encountered a number of cosmologists hearing good things about me from other scientists before meeting me, so I have little doubt that LORs will be my biggest strength. A few faculty at the schools I'm applying to have mentioned "putting in a word on my behalf" to the admissions committee.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:
Not sure how much impact this can have, but I am a preceptor for calculus-based physics, worked as a math and language arts tutor at public inner city schools for two years. I also mention that I am good at graphic design in my CV, which should be evident from my talk slides in the portfolio that some schools accept.

Applying to Where:

Harvard - Astronomy - Cosmology Rejection via email to check website 2/12
Princeton - Astronomy - Computational Cosmology Rejection via email 1/31
Yale - Astronomy - Cosmology Unofficial acceptance via email 1/29, official acceptance via email to check website 1/31. $34,500 + $4,000 for bringing NSF money with me + an additional named fellowship. Will attend :)
Chicago - Astronomy - Cosmology Rejection via email to check website 2/27
UC Berkeley - Astronomy - Cosmology Invited to interview 1/3 Rejection via email 2/9
Stanford - Physics - Cosmology Rejection via email 2/23
Ohio State - Astronomy - Cosmology Waitlisted 2/7 Email asking if I wanted to be taken off the wait list 4/1 - declined.
Pittsburg - Physics - Cosmology Accepted via email to check website 2/14. 9-month TA $18.5K. Happy Valentine's. Let's face it, grad school is my girlfriend.
Carnegie Mellon - Physics - Computational Astrophysics Accepted via email 2/9. $21.5K 9-month / $29K 12-month TA.
UC Santa Cruz - Astronomy - Cosmology Rejection via email 2/15
Michigan - Physics - Computational Cosmology Accepted 2/6, $30.5K, 4 semester RA fellowship, $2000 first year bonus. Received two extra fellowship offers after I declined a spot in their program. Something happened there.
Durham University (UK) - MSc in Physics - Cosmology Invited to interview 1/23 Recommended for admission 2/1. Official offer 2/13.

Fulbright U.K. Physics Shortlisted and invited to interview 1/30 Awarded!! 4/9
NSF GRFP Awarded! 4/2
DOE CSGF Not awarded 4/12 Can't get them all :D

Post-decision thoughts: The fact that I got about as many acceptances as rejections, in my view, shows that I picked the right range of schools. I reached a little, had one safety that I would be more than happy to attend, and am happy with the result.

As far as fellowships go, I participated in the proposal prep workshops that my school offered for the NSF and had a research advisor comment on it after a couple of grad students commented on my first drafts. I also had input /comments (albeit not much) from a prospective advisor at one of the schools, which I listed as my prospective institution in the GRFP application. FWIW, that school didn't accept me :lol:

As far as Fulbright, I thought of applying for it three weeks before my school's internal deadline, which is very little time and don't recommend rushing this application. I had to track down one of my recommenders while he was on a trip in a remote location. What was good, though, was that I emailed a professor abroad with an email outlining my general idea, asking questions about details of the science, and with the subject line along the lines of "Fulbright fellowship to work you on <subject>". The exchange I had with that advisor went a long way in making my application strong.

I found that famous professors respond within an hour when I emailed them with the subject line "<blank> fellowship to work on <blank>". In the body of the email, I'd supplement my project idea and request for whatever I needed from the professor with a short list of the people I had worked with. It was pretty darn effective when the project idea was specific.

Finally, if you've had the fortune of being awarded both the NSF GRFP and an international 1 or 2-year fellowship like Fulbright, Rhodes, Churchill, etc., you can keep both *if you ask the NSF coordinating official at your PhD institution to put you on reserve before accepting the GRFP*. This requires them to enroll you in a special way that isn't a regular enrollment deferral. I believe they also need to get NSF approval, but that doesn't take long.

Recommendations for future students:

I have learned a lot from reading this website, and so I'm going to work hard to transmit knowledge to the future students here. The hardest things about the application (for me) were: pGRE, where to apply, how many schools to apply to, and Personal Statement.

-pGRE: I studied for about 2-3 weeks and only took the test once (September) but if I were you, I'd take the pGRE in April of your Junior year to get a sense for it, and then study regularly through the summer. The practice exams are good indicators of the real test. I think that the test is fair, useful and intuitive. It's also fun. But you have to confidently move throughout the 100 multiple-choice questions in a short amount of time. The best way to practice is under test conditions.

-where to apply: I was lucky to have several friends/mentors who recommended me a lot of good projects to work on. So I first looked for projects I want to work on, and then made a list of schools working on those projects. In my case, the projects are experiments.

-how many schools to apply to: I did not apply to very many schools as you can see (only six). But for the schools I did apply to, I spent about a week researching each school and making contact with professors via email and Skype. It is a question of application quality vs. quantity... you will be quite busy Senior Fall with courses and research, so it will be hard for you to balance this.

- Personal Statement: I recommend a work-focused statement. I wrote a short beginning paragraph which summarized my goals and motivations. The statement was then sectioned into headers: "Research", "Academics" etc... and I wrote a paragraph for each of my main projects. The sentences were about what I contributed to each project. The final paragraphs were specific to each school: which projects I was interested in joining and why, the contributions I was hoping to make, etc. I liked this version better than a personal essay because it directly discussed the technical problems I hope to solve. However, such a statement might be more like everybody else's.

- Overall thoughts: First, I'm pretty advantaged in this process because I'm a white female US citizen experimentalist. This means that my relatively low pGRE score (72%) didn't stop my application from being considered at any school I applied to. Ultimately I could afford to gamble and use the time I could be studying for pGRE (and save money and time it costs to re-take the test) to work on my research. Beyond this initial advantage, I think what made my application competitive at even the top schools was 1) that I took the experiments I was applying for seriously. I researched them like it was my job until I thought up good questions and brainstormed initial solutions to current problems. Also, 2) I was not shy about talking with professors and discussing the current issues about their projects with them.

Despite my GRE writing score I actually do know how to communicate effectively and have well-written personal statements.

Applying to Where: All for CMT - QPT, Holographic Duality, Topological Order

UIUC - Physics (Feb. 9: ACCEPTED for Ph.D via email + ~$23k TA)
Princeton - Physics (Feb. 14: Rejected via email)
Caltech - Physics (Feb. 6: ACCEPTED for Ph.D via email + ~$34k TA/Fellowship) WILL ATTEND
Cornell - Physics (Jan. 29: ACCEPTED for Ph.D via website/email + ~$30.5k Fellowship)
U Chicago - Physics (Feb. 1: Rejected via website/email)
UMD - Physics (Feb. 12: ACCEPTED for Ph.D via email + $36k Research Fellowship at JQI)

Overall I feel I could've done better, but extremely grateful for the offers I received.

Advice to future applicants:
The market for hard condensed matter theorists is saturated. I would compare it to the state of string theory applicants 20 years ago. Switch to soft matter if you know what's good for you. My application to Caltech was tailored towards the quantum information angle, which is likely why I was admitted. Theory in general is difficult to get into, but if you want to do strongly correlated electron systems, holography in condensed matter, or topological order you'd better have extremely good qualifications.

Don't graduate early unless you have to. Use the extra time to develop connections, conduct more research (get published if you can), and APPLY FOR EXTERNAL FUNDING. Take graduate QFT if you can. I don't think a slightly higher GRE score would have helped me, nor a slightly higher overall GPA. If you want to be a theorist you should know the material and the current avenues of research like the back of your hand. Read recent publications and prove that you are capable of working at that level. That's about your only shot at getting into the top schools, particularly if you're a male theorist from a less than top ten university like I am. And seriously, having your own guaranteed funding source is like an automatic pass to any school you want to go to.

I didn't contact any prospective advisors before being admitted, but I'm not convinced that makes any difference.

All in all I guess I did pretty well for a junior

Best of luck to all future applicants!

Some Thoughts:
Even with a low GPA you can get into top-tier universities, provided you have research experience. I was extremely worried that I wouldn't get accepted anywhere because of my low grades my junior year. That's why I applied to so many schools. If I were to do it over again, knowing what I knew now, I would only apply to the top half of my list.

GRE Scores :
Q: 165
V: 159
W: 3.5
P: 850


Research Experience:
1 semester, I researched a combinatorial game based on numerical semi-groups.
1 semester, I classified, enumerated and proved some general results about comminiscule Coxeter groups.
2 years, I have worked on various projects dealing with colloidal functionalization, mono-layer production, actuation and propulsion of micro-scale structures and many body interactions of colloidal particles.
1 summer, I did an REU in theoretical soft matter physics analyzing floppy modes of elastic lattices (surprisingly complex and relies heavily on algebraic geometry).

Sadly, I have no publications out, but one is in preparation. In total I have given 3 talks and 1 poster presentation.

Research Experience:
Luckily found three planets at the end of this summer in K2. Paper accepted for AJ. Have a idea for a second paper. Hope to get it out before I graduate but not before the application.

Worked with a large group at Princeton. Was included as co-author in 4 papers. Also took a year off after graduation to work at the telescope in Chile. Good exposure to life as an instrumentalist.

Undergraduate research and thesis focused on cold plasma. The work led to publication of 3 papers. Some of my experimental work is still being modeled, and probably can lead to a fourth paper.

Short term projects at CERN, and in AMO. But not much panned out of them.

Cornell University -- Rejected -- No one working on exoplanets here. I applied because of great PS department. In hindsight should not have applied here.
University of Chicago -- Waitlisted
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I applied to 21 places, and paid application fee upto $125 at some places (should not have had applied to Berkeley probably as I withdrew even before the results were in). It was expensive. But for me it was worth it. I never dreamt that I would get into so many great programs. I would have been happy at many of these places, but with the luxury I had been given, I have decided to attend MIT. I never dreamt of getting into MIT, if I had applied to a fewer places MIT probably would not have made my list. My prof. at MIT told that I was selected because of my unique background, and strong recommendations. Also, I found having a Master's did overall boost my chance for application. And publication is perhaps the single most important factor in the application process, and I got very lucky in that regards. But it did teach me many important lessons.

Final Thoughts:
I didn't expect so many offers, very happy with how thing turned out. Like everyone else on the forum, I have to recommend Conquering the Physics GRE - Kahn and Anderson. I added over 200 points and 40% to my score using a combination of that text and older exams. I never made it into the elusive 990 club, but you can evidently still get into some solid programs without that membership. This was a stressful and expensive process, but I am beyond excited to be attending UNC this fall. Good luck to those who are still waiting and congratulations to everyone else with green text in their profiles!

Undergrad Institution: Midwest Liberal arts school known mostly for its Business and Engineering
Major(s): Physics, Math
Minor(s): None
GPA in Major: Physics (4.0), Math (3.89)
Overall GPA: 3.97
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: No idea. Probably near top.
Type of Student: Domestic straight white male.

GRE Scores :
Q: 165 (89%)
V: 162 (91%)
W: 3.5 (42%) :roll:
P: 840 (76%) (Conquering the Physics GRE by Khan and Anderson is an absolute MUST)


Research Experience: 18 months in a biophysics lab. 1 conference. 2 publications with 1 more on its way. 2/3 as first author.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: A few scholarships. Nothing fancy.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Was a UA for one semester for a Psychology professor.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Not that I can think of.

Special Bonus Points: One of my recommenders is a Michigan alumnus. We'll see if that makes any difference.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: Nope. Not really.

Applying to Where: (Expressing interest in HEP/condensed matter, especially with a computational focus)

Waitlisted ACCEPTED Rejected

Approximate order of interest:
Indiana Jan 6: ACCEPTED ($18,333 10 month TA + $5000 first year bonus [does not included summertime work {negotiable with professor}]) - WILL ATTEND
Penn State No Response :\
Michigan Feb 7: Rejected (I guess that letter didn't make a difference)
Wisconsin Jan 31: ACCEPTED ($26,832 12 month TA/RA [TA for 9 months, RA for 3 months {June-August}]) - Declined
Texas A&M No Response :\
Case Western Phone Interview (2/27) - Declined
William & Mary No Response :\
(Last Updated: 03/29)

Thoughts: Was surprised by the Wisconsin acceptance. It didn't feel like a very good fit to me.
Very pleased with the Indiana acceptance. I went for an "incognito" visit the weekend after I got accepted and everyone was very nice and helpful and the campus is beautiful (the student union building is AMAZING). I think that me and one of the condensed matter professors have mutual interest in each other. There's an official physics open house in March. I'm planning on going to that and if everything goes well, I'll probably accept this offer unless something crazy happens with Penn State.

Final Thoughts: Very Pleased to be attending IU. Was kind of surprised/disappointed with the lack of response from some of the schools...
But, who cares! I'm happy with the way that things worked out.

Everyone else: Best of Luck in making final decisions in the next ~2 weeks!

Undergrad Institution: Large state school, ~ #20 in physics
Major(s): Physics, Mathematics, Astronomy
GPA in Major:
3.81 Physics (All As and A-s, nothing lower)
3.50 Math (proof-based courses killed me. I got Bs in both real analysis and abstract algebra)
~3.7 Astro (it depends on how you calculate it since so many physics classes count towards the major)
Overall GPA: 3.77
Length of Degree: 5 years
Position in Class: N/A
Type of Student: Domestic Native American/White Mix, Male

GRE Scores:
Q: 164 (87%) (physics programs don't care if you can find the 2000th term in a sequence given a pattern of 3 numbers)
V: 158 (80%) :oops: (slow reader)
W: 4.5 (82%) :oops: (didn't leave any time to proof-read)
P: 890 (83%) :lol: (literally took this 3 times - first 680, then 740, then this. Conquering by Khan, Anderson is a must!)


Research Experience: (at time of application not including spring semester)
- 2.5+ years in CME (in superconducting quantum computing), 1st LoR
- 1.5+ years in computational cosmology (seemingly non-intersecting, I know, I just like it), 2nd LoR
- 1 REU at top 10 program in CME (also superconducting quantum computing), 3rd LoR
- 1 first-author cosmology publication in preparation (at time of application processes, still mentioned it)
- 1 cosmology poster presented at AAS

Awards/Honors/Recognitions:
None really, I didn't seize the opportunities to apply for a lot of them.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: NOTE: Only putting on what's going on my application, lots of people seem to include stuff that admissions committees don't even know about.

- One 2-year part-time job as a science blogger for an environmental science company, which I guess counts as a science education and communication bonus.
- One 1-year paid writing position for a college-prep company aimed at gender and racial minorities, so education + diversity points I guess.
- President of physics club for one year, outreach coordinator for another.
- Been a tutor through the physics club since Freshman year.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:
None that I can think of :?:

Special Bonus Points:
- Strong letters (all about research - no "they did well in my class" stuff)
- Strong SoP (life experience that I get to emphasize)
- Taken almost every physics elective offered (solid-state, atomic, optics, electronics, even a quantum information course)
- 3 grad classes (GR, a group theory course offered through the physics dept, one astro course on radiative processes), spring semester not included
- Also emailed the crap out of people I want to work with, had several great skype and phone conversations. One guy at MIT even invited me out to meet him and his group, so that was pretty exciting. Made the most of it and talked to as many people (both at Harvard and MIT) as I could while I was there.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:
- I studied abroad for a semester, idk if that has any affect.
- Also mentioned the people I met with/talked with over the phone in my SoP, but that's a given.

Applying to Where:
- Mostly CME, high emphasis on superconductivity, strongly-correlated materials, and/or quantum computing (QC). Some computational cosmology (CC) and/or experimental cosmology (EC) programs.

NSF GRFP : Not Awarded. :evil: Super salty about this considering I got 4 "Excellent"s and 2 "Very good"s with absolutely glowing comments... How in the world am I supposed to improve if all the comments said I was fantastic? It's a frickin lottery.

-----------------------vv Physics vv------------------------

Stanford - Physics - CME (showing sub-interest in AMO) : ADMITTED! (via email, February 22) Amazing 2 yr SGF through physics AND the E.D.G.E. fellowship (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) holy crap they want me - WILL ATTEND!!!
Princeton - Physics - CME, QC : ADMITTED! (via email, February 9), Fellowships provide support to first year grad students ~ $29,000/9mo + RA ~ $7,000/3mo, so total ~ $36,000 for the first year. If I get the NSF fellowship, they'll add another $4k to make it $40,000 (!!!) - Declined

MIT- Physics - CME, QC (showing sub-interest in CC) : REJECTED (via website, February 13). Got into applied physics program so not really upset. What matters is your advisor anyways! :wink:
Harvard - Physics - CME (sub-interest in EC) : REJECTED (via email to check website, February 21). Don't know why it took them so long to send rejections considering acceptances were sent out 2 weeks ago. It's not like we didn't know lol
Caltech - Physics - CME, QC : REJECTED (via email, March 7) Wouldn't have attended anyways at this point, just good to hear back. Congrats to those admitted!
Cornell - Physics - CME (showing sub-interest in EC) : REJECTED (via email, February 23) lol
UChicago - Physics - CME, QC : REJECTED (via email to check website, February 1). Semi-surprised by this, since my REU was there this past summer.

TO ALL MY FELLOW UCHICAGO REJECTS: Do not feel bad at all. They were really tight on admissions this year. When I talked to the chair this past summer, he said they had an extraordinarily large retention last year and were going to send out a lot fewer acceptances this year. There are plenty of perfect applicants that got rejected. I estimate that their acceptance rate this year will be < 9% due to rejecting overqualified candidates (why accept you and take the risk of having you attend if you have an excellent chance of admission to a higher ranked school?). It's just a bad year!

-----------------------vv Astro vv------------------------

UC Santa Cruz - Astro - CC, EC : Made short list and interview request (via email, January 31), scheduled for February 2. ADMITTED! (via email, February 8 ) RA ~ $33,000/yr + $4,000 fellowship/yr for 2 years (!!!) - Declined
UC San Diego - Astro (applied through physics department, technically physics PhD) - CC, EC : ADMITTED! (via email, February 1), financials TBA - Declined

UChicago - Astro - CC, EC : REJECTED (via website, March 2) one of my friends is on the waitlist and REALLY wants to go so I'm actually kind of happy about this... I can already go to UChicago through IME
Harvard - Astro - CC, EC : REJECTED (via email to check website, February 12). Not even slightly surprised :wink:

-----------------------vv Applied Physics vv------------------------

MIT - EECS (Applied physics route) - QC, CME : ADMITTED! (via email, February 7) RA ~ $41,000/yr + benefits + 9 mo Lemelson Fellowship (!!!) - Declined. This one was hard to turn down but I don't want to do engineering, at least not yet.
UChicago - Institute for Molecular Engineering - (solid-state) quantum computing : ADMITTED! (via email to check website, January 12) RA ~ $33,500/yr + benefits - Declined


IMPORTANT TAKE-AWAYS AND ADVICE TO FUTURE APPLICANTS:

UCSC -- Feb 22 - Accepted! Noticed change in status after randomly checking the portal

UT-Austin -- Feb 1 - Invited to Open House

Yale -- Feb 7 - Rejected via email to check status through portal (First rejection! Woo!)
University of Michigan - Ann Arbor -- Feb 8 - Rejected via email (This one is a bit of a bummer)
Cornell -- Feb 16 - Rejected via email
Stanford -- Feb 23 - Rejected via email
UC Berkeley -- Feb 23 - Rejected via email to check website (Expected, but this one still hurts the most)
UCSB -- Feb 27 - Rejected via email to check website
Columbia -- Feb 28 - Rejected via email to check website

University of Washington - Decided to not apply

My prediction: Rejected from Berkeley, Santa Barbara, Stanford, and Columbia. I'll get into exactly one of Yale, Cornell, U-Michigan, and Santa Cruz and denied from the rest. I'll be accepted to BU and Austin. We'll see though.
Edit: Looks like I can make it as a clairvoyant if the physics career doesn't work out ;)

I realize this list is a bit ambitious. But I'm happy to take a year off and get some more research experience if things don't pan out this time around, so I'm aiming high! I wish everyone the best of luck with the application process. We'll get through this!

Concluding Thoughts:
The final outcome is exactly what I expected. I think my application was strong enough that it was worth trying for some of the top-10 programs, but my non-stellar PGRE score and limited research experience held me back. Applying for Hep-Th didn't help my chances either. Overall, I'm thrilled with my options; The Weinberg theory group at Austin and the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics are both packed with people I'm very excited to work with. Looks like I'll have a difficult choice to make after I'm done with visits..

If you got accepted somewhere you're stoked about, congratulations!! If you didn't, don't stress. I know it's easy for me to write, but there's always next year (or the year after that!) It's also important to remember that there's more to life than just studying physics! Keep things in a healthy perspective! Peace <3

Undergrad Institution: Small highly ranked liberal arts college in New England. Good reputation overall, but no particular reputation in physics.
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): Jewish Studies
GPA in Major: 3.49
Overall GPA: 3.41 (this is above average for my institution--we have a grade deflation policy)
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: Probably a little above average, though not by much (average GPA at graduation is around 3.3)
Type of Student: White domestic female

GRE Scores :
Q: 160 (I was advised this score won't matter very much--hope that's true)
V: 170
W: Don't remember and don't care. It was high though.
P: 600 / 28th %ile (this one really hurt my feelings, especially in light of how many hours I spent studying... :cry: )


TOEFL: N/A

Research Experience: One advanced lab course in which I earned an A + two semester-long independent projects with faculty members + one summer of full-time research at another institution that turned into a senior thesis. Most of my projects were based in simulations and computational modeling, with some imaging and laser optics techniques for flavor. I have experience with Mathematica, MATLAB and Python.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Nah.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: I tutor for the physics department.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: I'm presenting my summer research at the APS March meeting in LA next semester.

Special Bonus Points: I'm very good with words--I write great personal statements. I have strong rec letters as a result of going to a small college and spending a lot of time with the same professors. I'm a woman, fwiw.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: My transcript shows an upward trend--had a rough first year and half (in part due to medical factors), but have been getting As and a few Bs ever since. My main interest is in computational physics and specifically nonlinear dynamics. I'm also interested in neuroscience and biophysics, which is reflected on my transcript. I have other interests but I'm focusing on those two for the purposes of writing applications.

Almost ragequit this whole situation over my PGRE score, but ultimately my ego can't handle giving up, so we're gonna see how this goes.

Applied to many reach schools, with Ohio State and UW being ~ match ones. As a result, the large amounts of rejections are not too disheartening. The rejections hurt, but nothing will beat that feeling when the first acceptance, UW, popped up on my screen. Such a rush of joy, and payoff for the hard work to this point (of course, its nothing compared to what is to come). Coming from a small liberal arts, I am super excited to be attending one of these great, large universities for the next step in my physics career!

Undergrad Institution: Large state school
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): Math and Chemistry
GPA in Major:3.98
Overall GPA: 3.99
Length of Degree: 4 years

Type of Student: Domestic white female

GRE Scores :
Q: 167 (92%)
V: 158 (80%)
W: 4.5 (82%)
P: <700 (October), I did pretty bad on this test, wish I had the chance to take it again. Part of it is that my curriculum is just not setup well for this test, like I'm learning stuff now that was on the test and I'll be learning stuff next term that came up a lot on the test.

Research Experience:
2 years at current university in experimental biophysics including:
• 1 summer scholarship program (sophomore summer)
• 1 university grant to work during this fall and winter term
1 REU at another university in experimental biophysics (junior summer)

1 first author publication (from summer REU)
Working towards a publication with research at my university. I don’t know that we’ll submit the paper in time, but my PI mentioned talking about it in his recommendation letter. He’s aiming for a very high profile journal and I’d likely be first or second author.

4 posters: one at a conference hosted by my university, second one as part of my REU, third and fourth are very big national conferences that will happen this winter.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Lots of small scholarships from my university (does this even matter?). The two research scholarships/grants I got from my university were pretty competitive and required a written research proposal to apply. Member of Sigma Pi Sigma (physics honor society) and Pi Mu Epsilon (mathematics honor society).

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Besides research, I worked as an undergrad TA one term for a general physics course and I’ve been working for the college of science at my university for 1 ½ years now. There’s a good amount of physics and science outreach that goes along with this job. Also I've been involved in Society of Physics Students and Sigma Pi Sigma leadership for the last two years (current President and Vice President). We set up a mentorship program within our department and have put on a lot of workshops.

Applying to Where: for all I am applying for experimental biophysics research, some for physics Ph.D.s and some for biophysics Ph.D.s

Accepted Waitlist Rejected Interview

UC San Diego- Physics-Rejected
Ohio State- Physics-Accepted and received 2 year university fellowship plus $3,000 research bonus! - declined offer
Carnegie Mellon- Physics-Rejected
Purdue University- Physics-Rejected
University of Michigan- Physics-Accepted! Received the physics department fellowship and a quarter time TA -declined offer
UIUC-Biophysics and Quantitative Biology-Invited for Interview Weekend-Withdrew my application
Ohio State- Biophysics-Accepted and received 2 year university fellowship plus $3,000 research bonus! -declined offer
University of Michigan- Biophysics-Accepted! -declined offer
University of Chicago- Biophysics-Invited for Interview Weekend-Accepted! -declined offer
UC Berkeley- Biophysics-Invited for Interview Weekend -Rejected after Interview
UCSF- Biophysics-Invited for Interview Weekend -Rejected after Interview
Princeton- Quantitative and Computational Biology-Invited for Interview Weekend-Accepted! -Will Attend
University of Washington- Biological Physics, Structure, and Design-Invited for Interview Weekend-Accepted! -declined offer

At this point I have submitted and paid for all of my graduate school application expenses. I ended up only paying $1,130 (that includes tests, sending test scores, and applications fees) and only having to pay 5 application fees since I got a lot of fee waivers through the BTAA Free App and from doing an REU last summer.

(5/15) Update: Well I kind of forgot about this for awhile, but just to recap I ended up getting 7 offers and in the end I was making the decision between University of Michigan (both programs), University of Chicago, and Princeton University. It was a pretty difficult decision but I decided to leave physics and pursue the quant. bio program at Princeton. In the end I decided to weigh my decision most heavily on quality of research rather than the exact name of my Ph.D. And honestly, I'm super happy with my decision and am so excited to start my graduate career at Princeton in the fall.

I wanted to add though, for people in future years, that this process was tough and it was long but you will get through it. I had three scenarios come up during the application season that sucked (and I'm sharing them because maybe you have them too and now you know you aren't allow): getting my PGRE scores back, getting rejected after an interview, and declining offers to schools I had interviewed at and really liked. After I got my PGRE scores back I almost gave up applying to graduate school this year but then I decided to push myself to still apply to some of the physics programs I was going to apply to and I also branched out and looked at programs that still had my field of research (biophysics) but didn't require the PGRE. Looking back on it, I am so glad I did this because not only did I get into a pretty good physics program (which just goes to show that the PGREs aren't everything), but I ended up going into a biophysics/quant. bio program instead of physics. Now as for the rejection after an interview, it sucks but just understand that if you have a couple of interviews then odds are you'll get at least one acceptance (I got 3/5 acceptances from interviews) and that you are good enough (if multiple schools thought you were good enough to interview then you are good enough to go there, it just might be a really competitive year with low funding so less acceptances). Finally, declining offers to places you like is hard, it feels like breaking up with someone. And it's also something you may feel like you can't talk about because your peers may not have multiple offers, so just know that other people also go through this and it's okay to feel sad about declining an offer. For me, I let myself feel sad for about a day and then I just focused on how excited I was about the program I accepted.

Thanks for running this useful site! I hope this post helps someone navigate what is not an easy process. feel free to contact me.

Having said that, I can also say that my resentment for the ETS, GRE, ETC is quite strong :evil:

I often wonder if anyone on a selection committee has explored this page... gets my paranoia going...

Undergrad Institution: small liberal arts college, exceptional math, geology, below average physics.
W/some standout faculty doing cosmology and gravity.
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): Math
GPA in Major: 3.7
Overall GPA: 3.6

Length of Degree:B.a.
-1 year at first school studying film, 2.7 GPA, and being an idiot.
Dropout - > transfer
-3 years to finish after that. some gaps in core physics curriculum...
-Have had 3 years off since graduation

Position in Class: near top. (small pond)
Type of Student: Domestic white male weasel (polecat-ferret hybrid)

GRE Scores :
Q: 167 (92nd) 06/2017
V: 167 (98th) 11/2017
W: 4.5 (82nd) 11/2017
P: 700 (50th) (2017, new scoring format) Well, if you're goanna be average, at least do it with precision EH?!

- may the ETS burn in a towering inferno, amen. If only it was a pull-up competition or a music trivia test.


Research Experience:
No publications, posters, conferences, never did an REU. weak. spent every summer in the outdoors instead of reseraching...
-Geophysics work, in the field and with computational modeling., (not publication quality)
-peripheral role in a Gravitational time dilation experiment with atomic clocks on mountains, (not one of the authors)
-an unfruitful observing run watching AGN on a mountaintop observatory. (insufficient observing time)
-Gave a public talk about Gravitational Waves, compact binaries, etc.


Awards/Honors/Recognitions:LOL!

Pertinent Activities or Jobs:
- Math and Physics tutor at school, after graduating did some in-home tutoring for money.
- solar installer, basic electrical work with renewables and off-grid energy systems.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:Elite level alpine climbing, sponsorships, grants, first-ascents, competitions, traveling internationally, 1000hrs/year training. Edited and designed publications. Visual artist, sold woodwork. Music, have built an analog synth, Had a public radio show. Lots of volunteer work. Really into hard sci-fi. like probably too much.

Instead of all these things I could have gotten some legit research experience or done well on the PGRE... but I wouldn't take it back. Got climbing grants for the two summers I could have done an REU. I feel like a whole human being...

Special Bonus Points: From the middle of nowhere? recommender who knows me well, did nobel-winning work with the Supernova Cosmology Project. A non-academic recommender who is a world-famous alpinist (definite risk, I don't think anyone cares about climbing but this person is a great writer). Another reccomender who doesnt know me as well and probably went lukewarm on their letter. (what are ya goanna do?)

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:
-Lots of coding skill: Python, Java, HTML, C. good at Mathematica
-experience building and repairing computers and phones.
-Have visited CERN as a tourist.

I have a diverse set of interests at the expense of academics: I haven't had my priorities settled enough to become a competitive applicant. Writing skill? maybe at a disadvantage with the bad transcript pre-transfer. had to do all of undergrad physics in 3 years. Graduated 12/2015 and took two years off doing non-academic things, working solar, and traveling to climb. Will have to re-learn how to student. Ready to work REALLY hard in any case.

U Alberta Edmonton - Physics - Buffering...

Just psyched for NASA to take that James Webb Space Telescope and put it where the sun don't shine. :shock: The Lagrange point of course.


FOR FUTURE APPLICANTS:

-A word of advice: Get your applications in early. Most schools are not going to be totally transparent about their process, and a rolling admissions system may be more common than people think, especially at smaller programs.

-Have lots of people proof-read your essays. It gets exhausting but people will give great advice. I had 7 plus kind folks read mine. The best edits I got were from friends who just started PhD programs, math, bio, whatever, and that had recently been through this process. Having professors, parents, or others read is less helpful since the specific demands and tone of a SOP is not going to be as fresh in their memories. Unless of course they've recently been on an admissions committee, in which case they are the ultimate resource for you. Even if you're a good writer, this process will tax you and make you get tunnel vision, missing obvious errors for no good reason. This is what friends are for.

-ALSO, if you're like me and have too many interests, narrow it down enough to sound like you have a plan in your essays. focus on one thing you really want to do. If you get admitted for that you can always explore other topics. The world favors those who have a plan... those who dabble (while they may sound cool at parties) will be left behind.

I don't have much evidence to support this, but I have the suspicion that cold-emailing professors before admission can cut both ways. In many cases they have to wade through tons of spam from applicants, and if their patience for the whole thing is running low then it may only unfairly serve to mark you as over-eager, warranting a negative response. If you've established communication by some other means, like at an REU or through a mutual contact, then great job, that will go a long way. If you want to email them cold, then make it brief, state your interests, and ask if they are taking new advisees.

If you're not trying to do H.E.T. at some big-shot place, the physics GRE doesn't matter. Connections, reccomendations, and research experience do. My dream is to work with LIGO, and that seems like a possibility now! Having managed to overcome some staggering academic failures and unusual past lives, I feel lucky to get admitted anywhere, and really glad to put this whole strange ordeal behind me and actually go to school!

And remember, this website has a certain selection bias. Only wierdos who want to talk about themselves are going to post here so take it with a grain of salt. The people you don't hear about may be better examples. Don't let anything discourage you, especially not the limited sampling of successes and failures that you'll see here. You have nothing to lose except application fees! All the hard work writing is just good practice at being a normal person who doesn't speak in math. And if you really want to do science it won't be the last exhaustive experience in hoop jumping you have to go through.

Grad Institution: Masters from a not so highly reputed university (but well known in my country)
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): N/A
GPA in Major:
Overall GPA: 67.7/100 (around 3.3/ 4.0)
Length of Degree: 2 years
Position in Class: Top 5 out of 60 students

Undergrad Institution: B.Sc. from a not so highly reputed university (but well known in my country)
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): N/A
GPA in Major:
Overall GPA: 64.3/100 (around 3.2/4.0)
Length of Degree: 3 years
Position in Class: N/A

Type of Student: International Male

GRE Scores : revised
Q: 161(78%) :cry:
V: 150 (47%) :cry:
W: 3.5 (42%)
Pgre: 760 (62%) :roll:

TOEFL: 106 (R: 29, L: 26, S: 24, W: 27) :P

Research Experience: One year Masters thesis about transition metal complexes. Published a paper in a local journal and another paper (peer reviewed) is going to be published in a highly reputed national science journal.

Awards/Honors: None

Related Activities or Jobs: A-level physics teacher in a highly reputed school of my country.

Special Bonus Points: Two strong recommendation letters from my professors. Third letter is (I think) not that great and not going to help.

Applying to Where:

(for experimental condensed matter physics)
Some universities ranked by US news with the ranking from 70th to 131st.
Georgia Tech - sure about the rejection from here but who knows :D .

Additional Comments: Applying for PhD in physics costs a lot of your money, time, and effort. It makes you restless and you can not help it. I was hoping for the PGRE score far better (at least 850) than that I got. It was my first attempt and I had got some days for preparation. I did what I could. Not going to pay for any other standardized tests. These tests suck. The research papers are not that great but I have done my best even though the resources were very limited. I am doing very well in the field of teaching and one of my professors has told me that he has mentioned this in the recommendation letter. Hope that strengthens my application.

Not sure about trying for the universities with higher ranking (in the range of 30-50). Still have some time before the international deadline. Any suggestions ?

Undergrad Institution: Large State School - Top 20 in Physics
Major(s): Honors Physics and AstroPhysics double
Minor(s): Math Certificate (like a minor in other schools)
GPA in Major: 3.89 (4.00)
Overall GPA: 3.78 (4.00)
Length of Degree: 3 years after transferring from tech college (8 years total :oops: )
Position in Class: No official rank, but at least top 15% based on honors offered
Type of Student: Domestic white female

GRE Scores : (revised or old version?)
Q: 159 & 161 (not great, struggled a lot on this one, its been a long time since Ive done this type of math)
V: 162
W: 4.0 & 5.5
P: 760 (Oct 2017) (Move than doubled my original score, thanks Conquering the Physics GRE - Still the weakest part of my app :( )




Research Experience:

Worked at Big Physics Lab for 3 years undergrad research - Completed junior year and senior year honors research projects, couple posters at various confrences, no papers (they are in the making :( ) .

Summer internship at Ivy league national lab - poster and internally published paper.


Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Just Dean's list many semesters, not many opportunities for this field at my school

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Worked as a tutor for 5 years at my tech college. Volunteer tutored ESL students while at University

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Have much real life experience, was training to be a professional athlete and open my own small business when decided to do physics, so hoping an interesting story and diverse background get some extra points.

Special Bonus Points: Couple of my recommenders are very well known in their fields, although I am jumping fields for grad school so don't know how much that will help. Took a lot of my classes with Honors which looks good. Worked at some of the best labs for the field that I work in.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:

Applying to Where: All for Physics - AMO except a couple that have good Plasma Programs. I know I have a wide range but I had no idea where I could get in, and I had the ability to apply to many, so I just tried to span the whole spectrum...


UIUC - Physics - AMO - ACCEPTED: 1/23 - 23K / 11mo - Fellowships TBA- Declined
Stony Brook ( SUNY) - Physics - AMO -ACCEPTED: 1/25 - 28K / yr - Declined
Rochester - Physics - AMO & Plasma- ACCEPTED: 1/29 - 28K / yr - Declined
UW Madison - Physics - AMO- ACCEPTED: 1/30 - 26K / yr + 3 Fellowships - Accepted
CU Boulder - Physics - AMO - Interview - ACCEPTED: 2/21 - 30-37K/yr + 3K fellowship [color=#4040FF]- Declined
Ohio State - Physics - AMO - ACCEPTED: 2/26 - 25,700/yr - Declined

(I suspect my GRE score and jumping of research fields may be hurting me a bit here... but whats done is done, didn't know I hated plasma until I had done it, and took the GRE before taking Quantum or Optics)

U of Chicago - Physics - AMO - REJECTED 2/1 - Email (Unsurprised)
Ann Arbor - Physics - AMO - REJECTED 2/8 - Email - Little surprised
Maryland - College Park - Physics - AMO - REJECTED 2/13 - Email - Hurt a little, not a lot
MIT - Physics - AMO & Plasma - REJECTED 2/13 - Website - LOL, would've judged them if they hadn't
Harvard - Physics - AMO - REJECTED 2/21 - I knew it was a long shot but still made me sad a bit
Stanford - Physics - AMO REJECTED 2/26
Columbia - Physics - AMO REJECTED 2/28 - Home run on the Ivy Leagues! That's OK, Boulder took me...
Northwestern - Physics - AMO
CalTech - Physics - AMO

Comments: I think that the GRE score doesn't matter too much if you are shooting for middle tier schools, it matters a bit more if you are shooting top tier and don't have a lot of papers etc. I wish I had done research in the field that I wanted to do grad studies in but idk if that would've helped me too much. In the end I I got into my top choices in labs and programs through networking and emailing with the professors, etc. I think that that went a long way. It still seems a bit random to me who gets in where. The biggest take-away I have is that I am very grateful for the number of schools that I applied to and I am SO glad I didn't take people's advice about only applying to a couple (especially since I wasn't the strongest candidate in certain areas).

March 18: More rejections (and lack of decisions this late) than I expected; I underestimated how heavily the PGRE is weighted. Nevertheless, I am quite happy with the results. OSU was one of the few schools that I applied to that does radio neutrino astronomy (my main interest) so I am quite excited to join their program. Their mascot is a nut so +2 cool points for originality.

March 20: Exciting news for Fall 2018 and forwards test takers: There's a new edition of Conquering!

I have a pretty crappy GPA and just as bad GRE results, but I have good research experience and great rec letters and a strong SOP, which will hopefully help me out. I didn't apply to many highly ranked schools, so hopefully I'll land somewhere.

Undergrad Institution: Big state school, which has a good physics department with lots of internationally known research going on
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s): Mechanical Engineering
GPA in Major: ~3.0
Overall GPA: 2.9 (Have been performing a bit better in recent semesters)
Length of Degree: 5 years
Position in Class: Average to below average
Type of Student: Domestic white male

GRE Scores :
Q: 154 (55%)
V: 158 (80%)
W: 3.5 (42%)
P: 520 (11%)

Yeah, I really bombed the GRE. If schools didn't require the PGRE I just didn't submit it.



Research Experience: 4 years working on scientific balloon payloads. Designed, constructed, and tested electrical and mechanical subsystems of payloads, and analyzed data and produced scientific reports of findings. Have worked on payloads that were investigations into cosmic rays, UV radiation, the 2017 solar eclipse, and gamma ray emissions from thunderstorms. Have given 4 poster presentations and 1 talk. Have progressed to the student team leader of this group. Also have one year of experience assisting a PhD candidate with their work on using UAVs for remote sensing.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Deans list for two semesters, Scholarship from my schools engineering department, Eagle Scout

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Member of AGU (presented a poster at 2017 fall meeting) and AIAA (traveled with my local chapter to DC to promote awareness of aerospace issues to congress). I also assist my department with scientific outreach to local schools and youth groups.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: Worked in customer service for a year, to get those "soft skills" :lol:

Special Bonus Points: I have connections with professors at a fair number of the schools that I applied to. My recommenders are also the dean of my schools college of science, the director of my state's space grant, and the associate chair of my department, so hopefully that will help. Also, for one of my ballooning projects I helped to write and submit a proposal to NASA, which after a competitive selection process they awarded us with $200,000 to conduct our project. Many of the schools I'm applying to are active with scientific ballooning, so my vast experience in that area should help. Also have experience with training and mentoring new students to my research group, as well as extensive experience in technical writing and presentations.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I'm hoping my strong engineering background will give me an edge.

Applying to Where:

Most of the places I'm applying to are for atmospheric or space physics, but some of them are for materials science, which I'm also really interested in.


Northern Arizona, MS Applied Physics ACCEPTED 2/6 via phone. $13.5k TAship, tuition waiver, health insurance
New Mexico Tech, PhD Atmospheric Physics ACCEPTED 2/15 via email. Waitlisted for funding
Southeastern Louisiana, MS Integrated Science and Technology ACCEPTED 4/26 via email.
Montana State, PhD Physics REJECTED 3/13 via email to check website
Stevens Tech, PhD Physics REJECTED 3/14 via email to check website
Chicago, MS Physical Sciences REJECTED 4/13 via email to check website
Louisiana Tech, MS Applied Physics
Appalachian State, MS Engineering Physics
North Dakota, MS Space Studies
LSU, PhD Physics
VCU, MS Applied Physics
Washington St. Louis, Physics Bridge Program


Update 2/8: This first acceptance makes me really relieved. I know parts of my application aren't very strong, so the fact that I'll have somewhere to go for sure has left me feeling pretty good.

4/26 Probably final update: I will be Attending NAU. Their program aligns with my interests pretty well, it's a great location, and plus they were the only ones to give me money haha. So far I've only heard back from six schools and I'm happy with going 3/6 out of those schools. I guess due to the nature of most of the programs I've applied to I'm not surprised that I haven't heard back from half of them yet, but that doesn't matter now.

If anything my profile is proof that you can get in SOMEWHERE and have a few options even if your numbers are less than stellar.

    I took a lot of post-secondary classes, so I was able to take almost all physics and math classes as an under graduate. At this point I have taken almost 40, so that looks good. I have 5 people I'm pretty confident will write very good rec letters with a few of them being outstanding, and 4 of them are from institutions other than my own, so that may stand out. I also grew up on a farm in a very small town and have "disadvantaged" status with a lot of applications, so that may help as well.
    Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:

    Applying to Where:
    My interest is in the computation and modeling side of biophysics/medicine. That being the case, I applied to a wide range of programs that are strongly represented in that area such as medical physics, biomedical engineering, etc. The Physics departments I applied to have people doing really good work in these areas.

Undergrad Institution: Caltech
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s):
GPA in Major: 3.76
Overall GPA: 3.55 (both before fall grades, which were ~4.1)
Length of Degree: 4+1 years (took ~ 1 year off after sophomore year for health things)
Position in Class:
Type of Student: Domestic white male

GRE Scores :
Q: 168
V: 169
W: 5.0
P: 990

Research Experience: 3 summers at my school, 1 summer at UCLA. First project was in experimental/applied physics, which ended up not really being my thing. Second project was really mathy which again wasn't quite my strength, and I was also fairly ill during that summer. So I didn't publish papers / ask for letters from either of these.

Third summer was experimental/theoretical biophysics. This resulted in a paper (2nd author of ~7) which we were submitting this fall. Rec letter #1 from PI (who I also had for a class).

Most recent summer was condensed matter theory. Started out on one project which ended up not working as we'd hoped halfway through the summer. Switched to something else which we finished up into a nice arXiv paper (2nd author of 2). Currently revising to submit to some different journals. It's a pretty weird paper lol. Rec letter #2 from PI (also had for class and have known in various contexts since I was a freshman).

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: None of note lol. I listed summer research funding (3 were technically 'fellowships'...) and one institutional scholarship I got.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: (Such as tutor, TA, SPS officer etc...) TA since sophomore year for a physics lab class. Had a lead position the year I took off for health. Rec letter #3 from prof who supervises this, who I interacted with a lot over the years.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

Special Bonus Points: (Such as connections, grad classes, famous recommenders, female or minority status etc...)
Many grad classes (~10), including stat mech, string theory, and quantum computation. Took QFT sophomore year (an eternity ago xD).

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:

Transcript is very inconsistent hahaha. Includes a D+ in an intro geology class sophomore year and a C in junior electrodynamics (Jacksonnnnn). But mostly A's.

I got some good feedback while writing my SOP, so it ended up strong. Only had to change first paragraph (+list of profs of interest in second paragraph) for each school, and less than I had expected which was nice.

My CV looks aesthetic. (Thanks LaTeX!)

I didn't contact any faculty prior to applying -- from talking with several people it seemed to not make a difference for theory. Also, my fall grades weren't available until pretty late (~Jan 21) so several schools may not have seen them, unfortunately.

Applying to Where:

All for CMT (and AMO theory for schools that have it), in the Physics department. Research interests are generally in quantum dynamics. I picked schools based on the criteria: (1) had at least 3 faculty I wanted to work with and (2) was somewhere I was willing to live for 5-6 years.

This ended up with quite a few, which I feel is necessary because my profile has some notable flaws (some bad grades, no papers published yet, research experience doesn't quite line up with proposed area of interest). But, I think I have some strengths too; overall I expected results to be quite random, and to get into 1 or 2 top-choice schools.

All my apps were submitted within a week of Dec 15.

UCSB (Feb. 27: rejected :( :( :( )
Harvard (Feb. 24: rejected :( )
Berkeley (Feb. 21: ACCEPTED!! with 35k stipend) -- will visit open house Mar 14-16 --- quick update: okay so funding at UC is kinda weird. GSI (TA) is 21k standardized across the UC system, for fall+spring. The department adds a 6.4k supplement for the first year, a summer research stipend of 7k, and a moving cost supplement of 1k. (Sok 35 all together). Once you get a research group and become a GSR, your advisor supplements the pay back up to this level. But if you don't get an advisor right after your first year, you'll get just ~26k from GSI, which is pretty low for the area. -- WILL ATTEND!!


Stanford (Feb. 23: rejected )
MIT (Feb. 13: rejected -- they didn't want me for undergrad either lol)
Princeton (Feb. 14: rejected )
UChicago (Feb. 1: rejected -- salty I turned them down for undergrad :p )
UMD (Feb. 12: ACCEPTED with 5-yr 36k JQI fellowship!! ) -- will visit Apr 1-4
Boulder (Mar. 8: rejected. Wish I could have visited, but glad this part of the process is finally over! )

Yale (Feb. 6: rejected )
Caltech (Mar. 7: rejected. I guess this is goodbye then :( )
UCSD (Feb. 2: ACCEPTED with 25k stipend + 8.5k first year award) -- will visit open house Apr 4-6
Boston (Jan. 24: ACCEPTED with 34k stipend ) -- will visit open house Mar 21-23
UIUC (Feb. 8: ACCEPTED with 23k stipend ) -- declined on Feb. 21. It is a fantastic school, but I decided the location just isn't for me given the other options I have at this point. I would have loved to visit, but I wanted the offer to go to someone else.

Undergrad Institution: Large state school, good reputation in both astro and physics
Major(s): Astronomy, Physics
Minor(s):
GPA in Major: 3.81 (astro), 3.64 (physics)
Overall GPA: 3.60 (turns out I suck at math :roll: )
Length of Degree: 3.5 years
Position in Class: Not sure. My school doesn't make this info readily available
Type of Student: Domestic, wonder-bread white male

GRE Scores: revised
Q: 156 (62%) :| (again, math)
V: 158 (80%)
W: 4.5 (82%)
P: 760 (62%)

Research Experience: ~3.5 years research experience (started 1 month into freshman year through until graduation) in three groups: stellar astronomy (~3 years) which led to 2 pubs (one as first author, one as third; both published in ApJ), machine learning with stellar archaeology (~9 months) which has a pub in prep as second author, and a white dwarf project (~1 year) which led to a research poster. Overall two posters and two forum talks.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Few departmental awards here and there, but nothing out of the ordinary

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: TA/Grader for one undergrad astro class

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: More of a blessing and a curse, but my research advisor left the university mid project to pursue a professorship elsewhere, so it took a fellow undergrad and myself a year longer to finish the project independently and get a paper out. I made sure to stress the independent research component and resulting pub in my SOP.

Special Bonus Points: I feel like the two recs from my research advisors will be strong (the third not so much, but they were just on sabbatical at Stanford so maybe that helps my app there?). One also said he'd "reach out" to his friends at some of the universities, whatever that means.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: For some apps I talked about my screenplay, short film and acting work (look for me as a background actor in the upcoming "Alita: Battle Angel"), which I'm hoping makes me somewhat diverse. Realistically it probably doesn't, but it makes me feel slightly less inadequate compared to all of y'all talented folk

Applying to Where: Mostly all for theory black hole/relativistic computation or dark matter/neutrino phenomenology research, despite having no prior experience in these fields :oops: Super ambitious list but a guy can dream, right?

Undergrad Institution: University of Colorado - Boulder
Majors: Physics
Minors: Applied Math (1 course short of a second major), Astronomy
GPA(s): 3.235 Overall, 3.164 Major, 3.5 in APPM
Length of Degree: 3 years (4 supposedly, but I'll finish in 3)
Position in Class: Highly unflattering, ~60%?
Type of Student: International Male

GRE Scores
Quant: 160
Verbal: 160
Analytical: 5
Physics: 990

Research Experience:
Two years on a computational Plasma physics project (First author paper in the works)
Six months on a cosmology project with a fairly big name in the field. Obtained major results. Possible paper in ~1,2 months

Lots of independent computational projects including a parallelized FEM elastic deformation code, a GPU based real-time simulation of a Black Hole, a merchant AI model (which led to a single author paper), a simulation of stellar nucleosynthesis upto Iron for use as a teaching tool, a fast turing-complete scripting language for video games, a game engine for 2D isometric video games.

3 Summer projects (one in high-school) on Geophysics and Cosmology respectively

Publications
Single author paper on modelling historical economic processes with applications to video games

Awards:
I've been let into the honours program! (sarcastic gasp)

Special Bonus Points:
1. I have a single author pub to my name, albeit in APPM as opposed to Physics
2. 2 solid research recos and one very solid course reco each in APPM and Physics
3. 2+ Years working as a part time System Admin for the CU Supercomputer. Hopefully a brownie point for the computational folks

5. Took 3 grad classes, Geophysics, General Relativity and Computational Plasma Physics and 5 grad classes that had an undergrad course number (Plasma Physics, QFT, Parallel Algorithms, Advanced Computer Graphics, Modelling in APPM). Got As or A-s in all of them.

Applying to:

Dream Schools
Princeton - (Astrophysics) - Theoretical Astrophysics (Rejected 1/31 via email) Eh, was a long shot anyway
Columbia - (Physics) - Theoretical Astrophysics (Rejected 2/28 via email)
University of Michigan - (Physics) - Computational Cosmology (Rejected 2/08 via email) Yeah, this was a bit of a reach too
University of Maryland - (Applied Math) - Nonlinear Dynamics (Rejected 4/20 via email)
University of Chicago - (Applied Math) - Turbulence and Astrophysical Hydrodynamics (Rejected 3/21 via email)
Michigan State University - (CMSE) - Computational Astrophysics and Nonlinear Dynamics (Accepted 04/22 via email: $17k Stipend + Health Insurance + Full tuition waiver) Will Attend!

Intermediate Schools

Rutgers - (Physics) - Theoretical and Computational Astrophysics (Rejected 4/14 via email)
UIUC - (Physics) - Theoretical Astrophysics (Rejected 2/16 via email)

Safety Schools: (To be perfectly honest, I will be ecstatic to get one of these)
Michigan State University - (Physics) - Computational Astrophysics (Rejected 4/15 via email)
University of Virginia - (Astronomy) - Theoretical Astrophysics (Rejected 2/19 via email)

My low grades plus international status might bite me, but we'll see. I have a single author publication with two first authors (potentially) on the way. That ought to count for something

Debrief: Man that was harrowing. Short lesson: GPA is everything, GRE will turn a few heads -- especially if you're not female or underrepresented or both. Follow up on all your admissions schools to make sure that they look at your file and don't list just physics or astrophysics if you're interested in computational methods. Indicate interest in physics applied to EE or other fields (that's what got me into CMSE).

GPA in Major: 3.65
Overall GPA: 3.8
Length of Degree: 3 years
Position in Class: Unknown, but probably above average with a 3.8 gpa.
Type of Student: US citizen, white, male

GRE Scores : Revised
Q: 159 (73%) :)
V: 165 (96%) :D
W: 4.5 (82%) :)
P: 570 (22%) :x :shock: RIP--applying to 2 schools that don't require the PGRE, and an additional 2 schools that don't accept the PGRE so hopefully this doesn't ruin my chances of admission. My advice to everyone is to begin studying early on--I started studying in July through October but I wasn't able to get my score where I wanted it it to be. I personally didn't find the Conquering the Physics GRE book to be helpful, but most people I know (including people on here) highly recommend it.


TOEFL: Not taking


Research Experience: I have 2 years of research experience in gravitational physics with 1 lab/professor but no publications/posters. I've contributed to several short-range gravity experiments during this time.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Dean's list for multiple semesters.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Besides being a research assistant (paid), I was also the treasurer of a Finnish studies association on campus for a semester.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: N/a

Special Bonus Points: If I get into my dream school Northwestern, its most likely because I'm doing work on a short-range gravity experiment in which a professor at Northwestern is the PI--I also have a LOR from 2 professors collaborating with this PI, and a researcher employed by him currently. For Indiana University, I explicitly mentioned in my personal statement that I would continue researching with the same lab/professor, so this may help--plus I have 2 LOR from professor's at IU, including the physicist I'm currently doing research with. Idk if this matters, but I am a first generation college student also.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: In a few applications, I wrote a diversity statement that highlighted how fighting some personal struggles have made me into a better researcher--I heard conflicting opinions about doing this, so I didn't include it in all applications.

Applying to Where:

Northwestern University - Physics - Experimental Gravitational Physics (Phd) (Rejected via Email on March 1)
Indiana University - Physics - Experimental Gravitational Physics (PhD)

Undergrad Institution: Large Canadian school, not well known in physics. Somewhat well known for its quantum information, well known for Neuroscience.
Graduate Institution: Same as undergraduate, will have a MSc in Physics.
Major(s): Physics & Mathematics. Half finished neuroscience degree.
Minor(s):
GPA in Major: 3.92 in Physics, 4.0 in Math
Overall GPA: 3.95
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: Near top (suspect I'm second.)
Type of Student: Canadian Male

GRE Scores : revised scores.
Q: 170 (97%)
V: 170 (99%)
W: 6.0 (99%)
P: 970 (92%)
940 on my first pGRE attempt -- sadly I couldn't quite squeak the 990. Very pleased with my general GRE scores :D

TOEFL: Exempt -- native language is English.


Research Experience:
Five years of research experience (started in highschool).

    In high-school developed experiment control software for an entangled photon generation system, and a quantum key distribution system for researchers at my undergraduate institution. Resulted in a publication and a technical note (5th author on both or something like that) on quantum key distribution. One conference presentation.
    Spent two summers, one fall-winter term doing research in a medical imaging lab, specializing in MRI and near-infrared spectroscopy. Four conference presentations, three papers (1st author on a review paper, third author on others).
    Spent a summer, and then a fall-winter semester writing a physics honours thesis on neuronal avalanches and statistical mechanics. Developed extensive numerical simulations on highly parallelized computing clusters. Currently extending this project into a Masters' thesis, which I am aiming to finish in one year. Hoping to have two publications out before summer, however these sadly won't appear on my applications.




Awards/Honors/Recognitions:

    Dean's list every year
    Scholarships and research awards totalling >50k (Canadian).



Pertinent Activities or Jobs:

    TA for the physics department. Developed tutorials for our statistical mechanics course (3rd year undergraduate course)


Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

    Extensively involved in campus culture, on the leadership for several clubs on campus
    Strongly involved in outreach. Give talks at local science centre, to students interested in research, hosted an 'interdisciplinary research forum', speak at local highschools, volunteered to teach a particle physics 'masterclass' to highschool students
    Involved in an engineering club on campus developing a solar car
    Went on two exchanges to Norway, once to launch a scientific sounding rocket
    Went on a house building mission trip in second year?
    Taught Physics AP at my highschool when I was a highschool student?


Special Bonus Points: (Such as connections, grad classes, famous recommenders, female or minority status etc...)

    Since I'm a master's student this year, I have taken four grad courses (Advanced medical imaging, Advanced QM, Advanced Classical, Stochastic Processes), A+ in all of them. During my undergraduate degree, took two others (General relativity which went poorly: C, and module theory in abstract algebra: A).
    Started my program in neuroscience (deemed it insufficiently useful), and switched out in my third year. Still finished a math and physics degrees in four years total.



Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:

    Two withdrawals during my undergrad (neuroscience courses), when my Dad was diagnosed with cancer / broke his hip. Was involved in his home care.
    C in General Relativity :(. Mitigated somewhat because I took this before special relativity. Or any field theory courses. I've since used GR to great success on a few term papers and projects.

Mention both of these in 'mitigating circumstances' for schools that have such a section as part of the application.

Thoughts and Reflection

I have to admit, the fact that the first three decisions I got were admissions made me a bit too overconfident in a couple of my other applications. Most of my initial predictions were accurate, however. If I were to have done this application process again, I definitely would have not applied to a couple of the universities that I did and added one or two more places that I would have had a (possibly) better chance of getting into. All it really takes is one acceptance to take away a large amount of the stress though, at least in my opinion. I felt that completing 11 applications really burned me out, but it was a good number to actually apply to. I was honestly a bit surprised that I didn't get into any astronomy programs I applied to, but most of the programs I applied to were extremely competitive, and my lack of research in the field had to have hindered my application.

Advice to Future Applicants

Below are some points of advice I'd like to give to future applicants, though I'll skip over the stuff that everyone says because you've probably already seen it several times.

The Physics GRE: In my opinion, getting Conquering the Physics GRE is a must. I took a practice test in the summer of 2017 and did not do well at all, but after getting the book in August and going through the practice problems and the sections, I was able to identify my weaker points. The practice tests in the book are extremely helpful as well, and definitely prepared me for the actual exam in October 2017.

Personal Statements: Have someone proofread your personal statement, if possible, and make sure you have no typos. I don't really have much else to say here because overall I probably could have improved my personal statements more than I did, in some way. Be sure to actually read and respond to the prompts of each university though: some of them ask different questions than others!

Overall, just make sure to continue taking care of yourself during the application process, and start searching for schools and (if possible) preparing application materials early. Best of luck!

Undergrad Institution: State school, unknown in physics
Major(s): Physics
Minor(s):
GPA in Major: 4.0
Overall GPA: 4.0
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: Top, I assume
Type of Student: Domestic white female

GRE Scores :
Q: 169 (96%)
V: 163 (93%)
W: 4.0 (60%)
P: 760 (62%)


Research Experience:
1 year in theoretical soft condensed matter, 1 publication, 1 talk to department
1 year in computational fluid dynamics, 1 poster
1 more year in theoretical soft condensed matter, senior project
2 REUs in astronomy, 1 in planetary science with poster at AAS, other in galactic/dark matter

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Astronaut Scholarship, 2 university-wide scholarships, 2 physics department scholarships, a few others unrelated to physics, Dean's list

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Officer in local SPS for 2 years, member of 2 department committees, learning assistant for intro physics course

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

Special Bonus Points: Lots of theory and computational experience to make up for lack of astro courses/research in undergrad

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:

Applying to Where: expressed interest in theoretical and computational astrophysics for all

Harvard - Astronomy Rejected 2/12 via email to check website (lol)
Cornell - Astronomy Waitlisted 2/21 Accepted! 4/13 via email. I can't believe it :D WILL ATTEND!
University of Washington - Astronomy Interview request 1/16 via email, Skype interview 1/26, Waitlisted 2/6 via email Rejected 4/11 via email
University of Colorado-Boulder - Astrophysical and Planetary Sciences Accepted! 2/2 via email to check website Declined
University of Hawaii-Manoa - Astronomy Accepted! 2/17 via email Declined
Dartmouth - Physics and Astronomy Withdrawn 4/14 I never heard from them.
University of Minnesota - Astrophysics Withdrawn 4/14 I never heard from them, either.
University of Oregon - Physics Accepted! 2/7 via email Declined

Some thoughts (especially relating to astronomy):
- pGRE score is not as important for astronomy programs. A lot of schools don’t even want those scores anymore. Maybe don’t completely bomb it if possible, but don’t stress over it too much. Your research and letters will get you a lot farther than any test score will.
- You can get into a program doing research that wasn’t really available to you in undergrad. My school had no astronomy, but I took a couple astro courses from a different university, participated in astro REUs, and made sure the research I did at my home university would at least teach me some applicable skills. You just have to show you’re serious and not pursuing something on a whim because you think it sounds cool.
- I see a lot of people advising to email professors before applying. I didn’t do this and still had a very successful outcome. I don’t think it would hurt to do it, but it doesn’t appear to be necessary. The only extra contact I had with any school was with Cornell once I was waitlisted, and it was just a couple brief emails to let them know that I was very interested in their program. Maybe that helped.
- Everyone says this, but apply to a wide range of schools. You might be able to get in somewhere you thought you had no shot at, or one of your safety schools could surprise you with an amazing program when you visit.
- This applies to everything to an extent, but especially in astronomy, school rankings tend to be limited and somewhat unreliable. Don't get too wrapped up in reputation, just find places with good people and cool research where you know you can thrive. That's where you'll succeed, and that's what makes a good grad program. Also, if you're looking into astronomy, don't discount physics programs. A lot of physics departments have a little group of astronomers lurking about that could be a really good match for you.

Overall, I was extremely happy with my results and so fortunate to end up getting into my top choice right at the end. I didn’t expect so many acceptances, and I certainly didn’t expect to escape the purgatory that is the grad school waitlist. I don’t really have any advice for the stress of waiting because I know no advice I heard made any difference to me when I was in the midst of it all. It’s hard and scary, but you’ll survive. The worst possible outcome is you don’t go this year, you learn more and improve your resume, and you try again next year. It’s really not the end of the world.

Best of luck to all future applicants! You got this :D

Undergrad Institution: Small, midwestern liberal arts school with a small but well-funded and well-equipped physics department.
Major(s): Physics and Math
Minor(s): none
GPA in Major: 3.91 in physics and 4.0 in math
Overall GPA: 3.97
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: I've no idea, but I'm guessing from my GPA that I am towards the top.
Type of Student: Domestic straight white male (groundbreaking)

GRE Scores : General GRE as of Oct. 2017 and PGRE as of Sep. 2017 (I took both only once)
Q:165 (89%)
V:164 (94%)
W:5 (93%)
P:760 (62%)

Research Experience: Three summers for a total of six months of paid research in my undergraduate institution. This was astronomy research done within the physics department. I studied variable stars in a particular cluster, and my work dealt with variable star detection and data extraction using programs written in IDL. I've presented two posters and one slide show presentation at various research conferences. I didn't do any REUs, but I developed a close relationship with my research advisor which hopefully has resulted in a good recommendation from him.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: I have academic scholarships from within my undergraduate institution, have made the Dean's list every semester, but have not pursued any other big, fancy scholarships from elsewhere. I'm also in the physics honor society Sigma Pi Sigma and the math honor society Pi Mu Epsilon. Also an Eagle Scout, if that counts for anything anymore.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: I was a group mentor for a high school math modeling workshop at my college, and I graded math homework for the math department for seven semesters.

Special Bonus Points: Two of the schools I'm applying to were the schools at which two of my physics professors got their doctorates, and these professors have written reference letters for me for those two schools: UW-Madison and Northwestern. More generally, since I go to a small school with a small physics department, I've developed close relationships with all my professors, so hopefully my reference letters will be strong.

Applying to Where: Only six schools for me, but I'm not shooting for tier 1 schools, and I'd be happy staying at a less competitive school in the midwest, so it seemed to be the right choice for me.

University of Iowa - Physics - Astronomy Track - Jan. 30: ACCEPTED for Ph.D via website/email, 19K TA position April 3: Declined
University of Wisconsin Madison - Physics - April 3: REJECTED for Ph.D via email after I reached out to them
University of Minnesota Twin Cities - Physics - Jan. 23: ACCEPTED for Ph.D via website, 19.5K TA position, 4.3K summer research Will attend!
University of Washington - Astronomy - Feb. 7: REJECTED for Ph.D via website/email
University of Colorado Boulder - Astrophysical and Planetary science - Feb. 16: REJECTED for Ph.D via website/email
Northwestern University - Physics - Astronomy PhD - March 21: WAIT-LISTED for Ph.D via email April 11: REJECTED via email

I've seen a lot of very impressive applications on this forum, so I mainly posted this on here to show what is attainable for more typical applicants who didn't do 3 REUs, get a 990 on the PGRE, and co-author a dozen papers with the ghost of Enrico Fermi, God rest his soul.

Overall not entirely surprised by the results. I really enjoyed my Minnesota visit and am incredibly happy to be going there. Not surprised at all to get rejected by Boulder and Washington, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that I was at least waitlisted at Northwestern. No idea what happened with UW-Madison, though. I thought my chances were higher there.

UCLA - Astronomy - Jan 31 ACCEPTED via phone

U. Florida - Astronomy - Feb 1 ACCEPTED via email
U. Hawaii - Astronomy - Feb 16 ACCEPTED via email
Yale - Astronomy - Feb 7 REJECTED via email to check website

Final reflections/advice: I'm blown away at how well things have gone. I'm happy I put myself out there in my applications and got a decent mix of acceptances and rejections, and actually hit my dream school. Advice to future applicants: spread out your applications across your reach, maybe, probably, and safety schools, I'd say absolutely no fewer than 6 schools in total since applications can be so variable year to year. PGRE - do as many practice exams as you can and time yourself. Retake the exam as needed (I improved ~20 percentiles from Sept to Oct) and get the general GRE done in the summer if possible, that thing is just a nuisance. Revise your statements constantly and don't be afraid to throw it out completely and start over. Get friends/professors/trusted others to give you constructive advice, but remember in the end your statement is YOURS. Apply for fellowships like NSF, if anything to practice working on your applications. My statements for NSF helped tremendously when it came time to thinking of what to write for my SOPs.

Lastly, two things that aren't critical to getting into grad school (exhibit A: me)
1. REUs (at other institutions). I spent all 3 summers at my home institution doing research after going 0/20 overall with REU applications. You certainly need research experience if you want to go to grad school, since grad school is basically apprenticeship style training to be a research scientist, but if you get shut out of REUs its not the end of the world.
2. Publications. I don't have any; the closest I have is a conference proceeding for ICRC that I wrote and another I was coauthor in. If you don't have publications, make sure your letter writers can comment on your potential to be an impactful researcher, but proof of impact isn't necessary at this stage. You're still an undergraduate student, breathe.

I have been lurking here for 2 years. There are very few international profiles, especially considering that the majority of applicants are international. So here's my small contribution. Hope you find it useful.

Undergrad Institution: Unknown school from India. No reputation in Physics
Major(s): Physics
GPA in Major: ~3.0
Overall GPA: ~3.0

Position in Class: top 10% (yes we have massive marks deflation)

Graduate Institution: Highly ranked school in the UK. Very good rep in Physics.
Major(s): Particle Physics
GPA in Major: ~3.55
Overall GPA: ~3.55
Length of Degree: 1 year
Position in Class: Unknown

Type of Student: International Indian Male

GRE Scores : (Revised)
Q: 167 (92nd percentile)
V: 162 (91st percentile)
W: 4.0 (60th percentile)
P: 850 (77th percentile)


TOEFL: (R: 30 , L: 30 , S: 27 , W: 29 )


Research Experience: Six month dissertation in HEP-th.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Merit Prize in grad institution

Special Bonus Points: I am hoping for two good recommendations, from my dissertation supervisor and my undergrad professor.

Applying to Where: All in HEP-th / HEP-ex

Michigan, Ann Arbor - Rejected on 02/08 via email
Colorado, Boulder - Rejected on 03/08 via email notification to check website
Duke University - Rejected on 02/27 via email notification to check website
Stony Brook - Accepted on 02/21 via email to the unfunded Masters program - Declined
UC Davis
Carnegie Mellon - Rejected on 03/16 via email
UC RIverside
University of Florida
Massachusetts, Amherst - Invited to Skype Interview on 02/12 - Accepted on 02/16 via email! $21k/9 month TA + $7.5k possible summer RA
University of Virginia - Rejected on 02/19 via email notification to check website

North Carolina State
Perimeter (PSI program)
University of Oklahoma - Accepted on 01/25 via email! Initial TA for $1600 per month - Declined

EDIT 02/15:
So I just had the interview with a professor at UMass Amherst. He wanted to know why I am switching to experimental HEP, when my thesis and studies have been focused on theoretical HEP. Also asked me a few questions on what exactly I wanted to do in the field. I guess I should have described all this in my SOP. Anyway, the professor was satisfied with my answers and will be recommending me for admission. Fingers crossed!!

Why several rejections from US: Its very surprising. US universities don't give any feedback so no idea where my application went wrong. I know many people having similar or even weaker profile than me getting same places where I had (Fall 2017) or have applied. So I can only give one suggestion to the future applicant that don't just think, that if you're good (which you think) you'll get. You need good contacts otherwise just wait for rejections. Its really very annoying. They charge hefty amount in the name of application fee and don't even give feedback. At max you are going to review 200-250 applications over the duration of 2 months, and still you don't have any useful/specific feedback, I am not entirely sure if they even read everyone's application. I invested a lot of money and time, it was not worth for me. Anyway, I got my first choice, Max Planck, so I am very happy.

EDIT 1: I am actually surprised by the UChicago result, especially given the huge number of highly qualified applicants who were rejected. Word going around is that this year's admissions cycle was tighter than usual due to over-acceptances from last year.

Based on my admission, it seems that UChicago cares more about your supporting documents rather than your raw scores. I know that my application had a very strong LoR from a recent UChicago alumni and a (in my opinion) very strong statement of purpose. Seems these two were the winning combination.

Also, I want to take this moment to point out that this is my second year applying to physics grad school. Last year I was outright rejected by all the programs I applied to (including UChicago) because of an abysmal PGRE score of 700. If you have a similar outcome this year, don't lose hope. Study hard and remain resilient.

Undergrad Institution: Columbia
Major(s): Physics / Math
Minor(s): None
GPA in Major: a bit over 4 (A+ is worth 4.33)
Overall GPA: 4
Length of Degree: 4 years
Position in Class: near top I imagine
Type of Student: Domestic White Male

GRE Scores :
Q: 165 (89%)
V: 162 (91%)
W: 5 (93%)
P: 950 (90%)

TOEFL: N/A


Research Experience: I did three different research projects with my three summers. My first summer I did astrophysics research that resulted in a first author paper. Sadly, I've since had a lot of trouble getting this paper published. My second summer I did a math REU at my school that didn't result in much. My third summer I worked with a theoretical physics professor on some dS/CFT stuff.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Won a nice math prize in my school in junior year. Also a "Rabi scholar."

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Nope. Very socially irresponsible.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help:

Special Bonus Points: Took a lot of math and physics classes. While applying, I had already taken or was taking grad stat mech and grad qft I + II. I also took a grad math course in geometry. I also took some good non-grad classes like algebraic topology.

Tip: I just want to say that getting enough sleep the night before the physics GRE is extremely important, especially if you're like me and are never even awake at 8am. The first time I took the physics GRE I got 890 (83%) and I was pretty sad. The thing is that even though I went to bed early enough, I couldn't fall asleep until late because I went to bed too late the nights before. Before taking the GRE again, I prepared taking practice tests in the early morning and made sure to go to bed at a reasonable hour leading up to the test. With essentially no extra studying, my score shot up from 83% to 90%. I didn't even feel tired the first time I took the test, but I guess I was.

Applying to Where:

All for high energy theory because I'm a dreamer.

Thoughts: Honestly, this is a massive disappointment. Other than having a higher GPA and GRE score, I don't know what else I could have done substantially better at. People like to say that scores don't matter much, but it looks like that's a bit of a lie in my case. Makes it feel like I've suffered these past few years at my university for nothing. I should have just gone somewhere easier. I probably would have enjoyed college more and even had better luck with graduate admissions.

Note for future applicants: Do well in classes and on the PGRE, I guess? Also, if you want to study exoplanets, for the love of god don't over-emphasize this in your application. It's way too competitive. You'll have better luck focusing on another area that you have experience in and switching once you get into grad schools.

I'm posting so that other students may get a sense of what happens when you're a good candidate with a bad PGRE score. I opted to not submit my score to any program that didn't require it.

Undergrad Institution: Public school
Major(s): Physics, Mathematics
GPA in Major: 3.98
Overall GPA: 3.98
Length of Degree: 4 yrs
Position in Class: Top
Type of Student: Domestic white woman

GRE Scores :
Q: 165
V: 165
W: 5
P: 660

Research Experience: One first-author paper, one second-author paper. One second-author paper being drafted at time of applying. Four years of research at home institution. One summer at NIST. Two summers in international REUs.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Goldwater, Fulbright.

Applying to Where:
Accepted Rejected Waitlist Interview

Schools that received my PGRE score:
UChicago - Physics - AMO (Feb 01: ACCEPTED for Ph.D. via website/email)
MIT - Physics - AMO (Feb 09: ACCEPTED for Ph.D. via email)
Harvard - Physics - AMO (Feb 09: ACCEPTED for Ph.D. via email)
CU Boulder - Physics - AMO (Feb 02: ACCEPTED for Ph.D. via website/email)
Stanford - Applied Physics - AMO (Feb 06: ACCEPTED for Ph.D. via email + $43,000 full-funding for five years + $12,000 one-time sum + extra $6,000/year for five years) - WILL ATTEND!
Columbia - Applied Physics - AMO (Feb 12: ACCEPTED for Ph.D. via email)

Schools that did not receive my PGRE score:
Princeton - Applied Physics - AMO (Jan 05: Interview Feb 07: ACCEPTED for Ph.D. via email)

Cornell - Applied Physics - AMO (Feb 05: ACCEPTED for Ph.D. via email)
Caltech - Applied Physics - AMO (Feb 13: ACCEPTED for Ph.D. via email)

NSF GRF Awarded

Take-aways:
-- I drafted the list of schools that I would be applying to before I knew my PGRE score and did not change that list after receiving my score. I am really glad that I did that, as I might not have applied to MIT, Harvard, Stanford, etc. otherwise.

-- My research interests were very, very specific and I believe that this helped my application quite a bit.

-- I believe that my low PGRE score may have hurt my fellowship opportunities at some schools.

-- I did quite a lot of outreach but did not mention this in my personal statement; this space was used to convince the school that I would be a great fit research-wise. I left tales of my outreach for internal diversity statements / rec letters.

-- The PGRE caused me great despair for many months of my life as I was sure that it would end up limiting my opportunities. Many institutions are moving away from a make-or-break approach with standardized testing (at least for under-represented applicants). The test is non-predictive for long-term research success; it's a much better predictor of race and gender. Hopefully we'll see a full phasing-out in the coming years.

-- Good luck to everyone and know that by April 15th your life will be okay again. : )

Undergrad Institution: "Liberal arts college" but in effect a tech school. Not sure about reputation in Physics, but generally strong STEM rep.
Major(s): Physics
GPA in Major: 3.9+/4.0
Overall GPA: 3.9+/4.0
Length of Degree: 4 years
Type of Student: International female

GRE Scores : Revised
Q: 168 (94%)
V: 170 (99%)
W: 5.0 (93%)
P: 970 (92%)

Research Experience:

    One external summer REU (10 weeks) at LIGO doing on-site instrumentation work on the optics side. Did not actually accomplish much, since I was a clueless 2nd year undergrad.
    Quantum optics research at my home institution during the semester for about 5 semesters + 1 summer now. Did a significant amount of experimental work during the summer, now working on a somewhat more theory-oriented thesis. No publications, but in the process of preparing a paper for submission. Poster presentation at a quantum information conference.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: Nah. Dean's list for a few semesters, if that counts.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Graded for a number of physics courses ranging from freshman- to junior-level. Also graded a junior-level math course. Graded + tutored in computer science intro sequence courses.

Special Bonus Points: I'm female, I guess. Although I've only done formal research with one of my letter writers, the rest all know me very well both academically and personally.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter:

    I have a lot of non-major-related courses under my belt: all of the intro CS sequence at my college, including data structures + a couple of EE courses, one of which was an upper-level elective + a bunch of random courses in humanities/social sciences because ~liberal arts~.
    I was very specific about my research interests in my SOP: for all applications, I named at least three labs (and specific research areas in those labs) that I wanted to work with.
    A ton of typos in my SOPs because I was in a rush: missing words, duplicated sentences, incomplete sentence due to version control failure. You name an error, I've got it.

Applying to Where:
Caltech - Applied Physics - Optics/Photonics - (Feb 13: ACCEPTED for Ph.D with funding)
MIT - EECS - Optics/Photonics - (Waiting)
Harvard University - SEAS (Applied Physics) - Optics/Photonics - (Feb 12: ACCEPTED for Ph.D via email from PI + funding details pending; Jan. 25: Invited for informal interview with PI)

University of Oregon - Physics - Optics/Photonics - (Jan. 30: ACCEPTED for Ph.D via email + TA)

Unsolicited Reflections/Advice for Future Applicants

    Health and Wellness - The past application cycle has been incredibly stressful both mentally and physically, especially since it was concurrent with a semester of full of hard, upper-division classes. Despite my generally good stats and reseach history, I was still immensely stressed during the process due to a history of high anxiety and my upbringing pre-college. I am still suffering some of the effects of this period of time in the form of recurrent insomnia and gastric issues. For future applicants: please take care of of your health and general well-being during application season; use this as an opportunity to learn how to manage stress healthily---it will probably serve you well during grad school too. I've found that having people to talk to---especially, trusted professors---helps a lot. Reducing visits to this website (and the applicant profiles page in particular) when I was submitting my applications and waiting for my first admission to a program also helped.
    Statement of Purpose - When I was writing my SOPs, my professors typically suggested one of two models: (1) research-interest focused, and (2) qualifications-focused. Of course, a good SOP should include elements of both, but the difference lies in which aspect you focus on more. People will probably try to convince you that one model is more viable than the other, but IMO it's up to personal preference (and the preferences of admissions committees, which vary greatly, and so you might as go with your personal preference :P) I used the latter model because I'm used to technical writing and am more comfortable talking things that I have already happened (i.e. my achievements/qualifications and why they make me a strong candidate). Some of you might find the research-interest focused SOP easier to write, and the suggestion I received for that was to avoid trite "Since I was a child..." things, and go for coherent paragraph on the area you're interested in akin to an intro paragraph of a grant proposal. This demonstrates that you are genuinely interested, and are up-to-date/knowledgeable enough about your area of interest. Also, don't sweat the typos after you're done :P. I'm getting the sense that they read more for content than execution.
    Standardized tests - For the general GRE, get it out of the way ASAP (the summer before your last year of undergrad). It's like a souped-up version of the SATs. Do a couple of practice tests to get used to the format and time constraints and go for it. Study for vocab and essay structure, if you need it; the math is not difficult, but relies on high speed and accuracy, so practice that if you need to. For the physics GRE, study. I'm typically too lazy to commit equations to memory, but it's useful to memorize things for this. There are lots of useful guides online...and do all the practice tests you can get your hands on! The time limit is no joke.
    School search - Strategy varies a lot depending on how specific your research interests are. Talk to a trusted professor/research advisor to figure something out that works for you. I knew very specifically what I want to do, so my search was research group focused as opposed to ranking/school focused.
    Letter writers - This might come a little late for many, but if you're still at least a year from graduation from undergrad or master's, try to cultivate strong relationships with potential writers. Talk to your research advisors and make sure you make a strong (good) impression; if you have a major research experience, but do not have a letter from the advisor, it can sometimes be a red flag. If you've only mainly worked with one professor (like me), make sure you have course professors that know you beyond "This person got an A in my class." This means going to office hours, etc. For experimentalists, lab professors are good recommenders in lieu of research advisors.

Notes: I would say contacting professors really helped me a lot. Try to find professors in the universities you are applying, who are working in the area of your interest and shoot them a customized mail showing your interest in their group. It surely did help me to get admitted to my top choice, where it turned out my POI was the chair of graduate admissions :D

Few other things: 1.Get done with your GREs as early as possible. Do study for them, but don't be disheartened if you do badly in the Gen GRE. One of my friends got into Princeton with a 320. I have a feeling that Physics GRE is really quite important for admissions in Physics.
2.Start early on your SOP atleast a month ahead and get them checked by grad students in your lab, maybe even one professor. Be sure to give a copy of the SOP to your reco letter writers. (Then they will know which area exactly you are applying to and maybe tune their letters to that end)
3.Choose your reco letter writers wisely. Don't try to get recos from the top professors in your department, who don't even know you properly. Always get them from people who know you well, who can speak about your strengths and weaknesses.

Undergrad Institution: Big state school with US News physics rank about 40
Major(s): Physics, Mathematics
Minor(s): N/A
GPA in Major: 3.99
Overall GPA: 3.99
Length of Degree: 5 years
Position in Class: Top-ish
Type of Student: Domestic white male

GRE Scores :
Q: 167 (92 %-ile)
V: 164 (94 %-ile)
W: 5.0 (93 %-ile)
P: 740 (58 %-ile) Took it a second time (without further prep) and got exactly the same score

Research Experience: One year of relevant research experience with an advisor who is known in the field. I completed an honors thesis. Some math research experience at a community college I attended the first two years. This led to a published paper in an undergrad journal and a presentation at a national convention.

Awards/Honors/Recognitions: I got many awards at the community college, including an overall merit award given to a single graduate. I didn't really seek or win anything notable other than that.

Pertinent Activities or Jobs: Tutored math and physics for a year.

Any Miscellaneous Accomplishments that Might Help: I was a quiz bowl national champion at the CC level. I mentioned it very briefly in my SOP, but I doubt that professors really care about this sort of thing.

Special Bonus Points: My recommenders are respected, and I am assuming they gave strong LORs. My SOP was very strong due to my background and because I had a grant writer/physics professor help me. I am a domestic white male, but I have a very unique cultural background. First-generation college student.

Any Other Info That Shows Up On Your App and Might Matter: I am about ten years older than the traditional student. I didn't have a classical high school education, and for various reasons, I did not enter college until I was 25. I didn't mention my age in my SOP, but of course my date of birth does appear in my general application.

-I believe that the SOP was well-written and designed to show me as a person, rather than describe boring details on research work or studies. I also included a brief discussion on one or two interesting details in research work of some scholars working at the particular university, then explained why it is interesting for me.
-Joint certificate program - a cycle of courses on nanotechnology and spintronics provided by the University of Würzburg and my institution.
-I prepared the whole application using LaTeX to make it look more professional - maybe it helped to stand out.
-My thesis advisor has some connections at Stanford and UCB, he spent the sabbatical there and was a visiting professor a few years ago.
-Possibly MSc and a few grad courses - solid state, QM, ED etc.
(Such as connections, grad classes, famous recommenders, female or minority status etc...)

Conclusions:
It is possible to reach the world's top universities even if your undergraduate institution is around ~1,000 ARWU if you work hard enough.

Basing on my applications, you can see it is not crucial to have perfect test scores or grades (I got 3.0/5.5 once for the Physics classes, where 3.0 is the lowest possible to pass the course). Therefore, even if you did some mistakes during your freshman year do not worry, just push harder to make a progress.

The test scores should be reasonable - especially the math section of GRE and Physics Subject test, but you can find people with Q: 170 & Phys: 990 rejected from schools, where I got into.

I believe the most important were:
1) Research Work - I did as much as I could, starting during the early second year of my studies. This approach shows involvement and passion to what you do.

2) The Statement of Purpose is extremally important - be sure you did everything to make it as good as possible, also make it look professionally (I recommend using LaTeX). Start your research and preparation of this documents EARLY, I started writing about two weeks before deadlines I found it very exhausting. Be sure you are showing you as a person through describing the steps you took in your academic life.
I was rejected by three schools, which I attribute to the low quality of my SOPs, I did not really know which research group I was interested in at Caltech, MIT, and UCSB. Moreover, I was already tired with the rest of my SOPs so I made some more or less random choices with poor argumentation.

3) If you are accepted I strongly recommend attending the Open House, first of all, to make sure your dream school is really for you. Secondly - you can benefit, I feel that it is easier to communicate with the administration after visiting the particular school, I think it shows your dedication.

4) As you can see on the example of the University of Maryland the funding is somehow flexible - you can try to wait for a better offer. Maybe you can even negotiate with some universities.
