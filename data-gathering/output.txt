This is the most useful resource PhysicsGRE has to offer. If you have used this information in the past or are currently using it to help decide upon schools, I highly suggest you help out and post your own profile once you have applied to schools. Future members of this forum will find it very useful! Don't be shy!

Note from moderator:
  Profile threads are best when they only have profiles.  Please avoid making other posts on this thread.  If you wish to discuss profiles, it is helpful to have a separate "profile discussion thread", as was done in some past years.  Thanks.

My thoughts as of 2/14/19:
This has been a very wild ride.  I am so so shock, thankful, surprised that I was accepted anywhere, let alone that I have a choice between where I'm going!  Application season was tough, but waiting for responses was way tougher!  Concentrating on my classes while obsessively checking this forum and the Grad Cafe was not great.  If I could do it differently, here are some things I'd do:
1. Apply for NSF/any grant you can get your hands on!
2. Do NOT check Physics GRE or The Grad Cafe once you submit your applications (or at least, limit yourself!).  Just let the responses roll in as they come.  Don't compare yourself to others on this website.  You will never know why some people got in while you didn't!
Things I think I did right:
1. Attend the AAS: I met so many people, reps, students, and professors from the schools to which I applied.  I had a great time practicing my poster presenting skills and meeting people with whom I could work with next year!  I would suggest encouraging your institution to fund your trip up, as I believe it could have earned me two of the three acceptances I got!
