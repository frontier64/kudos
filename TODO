## In Progress

* Get better university data.
	- Handle slightly different names for universities (i.e. Harvard, University of Harvard, Boulder, CU Boulder, Colorado University at Boulder)
		- Found a list of common names for universities. Might be helpful.
	- Maybe reformat the entire data set to be an array of university objects
	- Cull bad university data
* Parse GPA data to handle unusual GPA's (i.e 7.69/100, 88/100, etc)
* Setup registration and login system
* Improve the general look of the website
* Calculate chances based off of university data

## Done

* Basic website formatting
* 95% accurate student data for years back to 2013 excluding university acceptance.
